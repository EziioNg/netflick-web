WEBVTT

05:00.676 --> 05:05.221
Bio-readouts are in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

05:07.725 --> 05:10.727
There goes our salvage.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.298
- How are we today?
- Terrible.

05:40.466 --> 05:44.511
- Better than yesterday, at least.
- Where am l?

05:44.678 --> 05:48.556
You're safe. You're at Gateway Station,
been here two days.

05:48.724 --> 05:52.268
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.188
Looks like you've got a visitor.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.942
Jonesy. Come here.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.111
Come here.

06:02.279 --> 06:07.534
How are you, you stupid cat?
Where have you been?

06:08.577 --> 06:12.413
I guess you two have met.
I'm Carter Burke.

06:12.581 --> 06:18.461
I work for the company.
But don't let that fool you. I'm an OK guy.

06:18.629 --> 06:24.133
I'm glad you're a little better. The weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

06:24.301 --> 06:30.098
It's just natural side effects
of such an unusually long hyper sleep.

06:30.266 --> 06:34.811
What do you mean?
How long was I out there?

06:37.106 --> 06:40.149
Has no one discussed this with you yet?

06:40.317 --> 06:44.821
But, l mean, I don't recognize this place.

06:45.656 --> 06:48.157
No, I know.

06:48.325 --> 06:51.828
It's just that this might be a shock.
It's longer...

06:51.996 --> 06:55.164
How long? Please.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.502
57 years.

07:00.212 --> 07:04.424
- What?
- You were out there for 57 years.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.678
You had drifted
right through the core systems,

07:08.846 --> 07:14.684
and it's really just blind luck
that a deep-salvage team found you.

07:14.852 --> 07:19.355
It's one in a thousand, really.
You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.

07:19.523 --> 07:23.026
You could be floating out there forever.

07:23.193 --> 07:36.873
Are you OK?

07:45.549 --> 07:47.550
God!

07:48.260 --> 07:50.219
Nurse!

07:51.513 --> 07:54.265
Someone get in here now.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.392
Now!

07:56.560 --> 07:58.728
- Hold.
- Please...

07:59.271 --> 08:01.022
Hold her.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.233
Kill me!

08:20.542 --> 08:25.421
Bad dreams again?
Want something to help you sleep?

08:26.090 --> 08:28.007
I've slept enough.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.055
Come here.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.563
It's all right.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.445
It's over.

09:14.888 --> 09:20.226
- Sorry I'm late.
- Is there any word about my daughter?

09:20.394 --> 09:24.981
I think we should worry about the hearing
now, cos we don't have long.

09:25.149 --> 09:29.152
I read your deposition, and it's great.
Stick to that and we'll be fine.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.988
There'll be a lot of heavyweights there -

09:32.156 --> 09:37.493
feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission,
Colonial Administration, insurance guys...

09:37.661 --> 09:40.329
Do you have any news
about my daughter?

09:41.874 --> 09:46.002
We did come up with some information.
Why don't we sit down?

09:46.170 --> 09:50.173
I was hoping to wait
until after the inquest...

09:53.177 --> 09:59.682
Amanda Ripley-McClaren -
married name, I guess - aged 66.

09:59.850 --> 10:03.269
And that was at the time of her death.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.314
Which was two years ago.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.151
I'm real sorry.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.121
Amy...

10:23.832 --> 10:28.544
She was interred at Westlake Repository,
Little Chute, Wisconsin.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.422
No children. I checked.

10:36.011 --> 10:40.806
I promised her
that I'd be home for her birthday.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.896
Her 11th birthday.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.076
I don't understand this.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.412
We have been here
for three and a half hours.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.290
How many different ways
do you want me to tell the same story?

11:07.251 --> 11:11.045
Look at it from our perspective, please.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.256
Please.

11:15.592 --> 11:20.930
You admit to destroying
an M-Class star-freighter,

11:21.098 --> 11:23.432
a rather expensive piece of hardware.

11:23.600 --> 11:29.605
42 million in adjusted dollars.
That's minus payload, of course.

11:29.773 --> 11:34.110
The lifeboat's flight recorder
corroborates some of your account,

11:34.278 --> 11:39.282
in that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426,

11:39.449 --> 11:42.451
an unsurveyed planet at that time.

11:42.619 --> 11:47.373
That it resumed its course and was
subsequently set for self-destruct, by you,

11:47.541 --> 11:51.377
- for reasons unknown.
- Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

11:51.545 --> 11:57.133
We landed there on company orders
to get this thing, which destroyed my crew.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.635
And your expensive ship.

11:59.803 --> 12:03.472
The analysis team,
which examined the lifeboat minutely,

12:03.640 --> 12:06.309
found no evidence of this creature.

12:06.476 --> 12:11.439
Good. That's because I blew it
out of the goddamn airlock.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.567
Like I said.

12:16.737 --> 12:20.823
Are there any species
like this hostile organism on LV-426?

12:20.991 --> 12:24.535
It's a rock. No indigenous life.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.998
Did IQs drop sharply while I was away?

12:29.166 --> 12:34.337
I said it was not indigenous.
It was a derelict spacecraft, an alien ship.

12:34.504 --> 12:39.008
It was not from there. Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

12:39.176 --> 12:45.473
And found something never recorded once
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

12:45.641 --> 12:51.687
"A creature that gestates inside a living
human host." These are your words.

12:51.855 --> 12:56.525
- "And has concentrated acid for blood."
- That's right.

12:56.693 --> 13:03.199
I can see where this is going.
But I'm telling you that those things exist.

13:03.367 --> 13:06.494
- Thank you. That will be all.
- Please!

13:06.662 --> 13:08.829
Kane, the crew member...

13:08.997 --> 13:13.376
Kane, who went into that ship,
said he saw thousands of eggs there.

13:13.543 --> 13:17.213
- Thank you, that will be all.
- Goddammit, that's not all.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.007
If one of those things gets down here,

13:20.175 --> 13:25.721
you can kiss all of this bullshit goodbye!

13:32.979 --> 13:40.736
It is the finding of this court of inquiry
that Warrant Officer E Ripley, NOC 14472,

13:40.904 --> 13:44.198
has acted with questionable judgment,

13:44.366 --> 13:49.870
and is unfit to hold an ICC license
as a commercial flight officer.

13:50.038 --> 13:55.042
Said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

13:55.210 --> 14:01.799
No criminal charges will be filed, and you
are released on your own recognizance

14:01.967 --> 14:05.386
for a six-month period
of psychometric probation,

14:05.554 --> 14:11.100
to include monthly review
by an ICC psychiatric technician.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.020
These proceedings are closed.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.285
That could have been better.
Look, I think...

14:29.453 --> 14:31.579
Van Leuwen?

14:31.747 --> 14:35.082
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

14:35.250 --> 14:38.919
I don't have to.
There have been people there over 20 years,

14:39.087 --> 14:42.131
and they never mentioned
hostile organisms.

14:42.299 --> 14:45.176
- What people?
- Terraformers.

14:45.343 --> 14:50.973
Planet engineers. They set up big atmosphere
processors to make the air breathable.

14:51.141 --> 14:55.394
Takes decades. It's what we call
a “shake’n’bake” colony.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.106
How many colonists are there?

14:59.816 --> 15:03.652
60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?

15:06.323 --> 15:08.449
Families.

15:10.786 --> 15:12.578
Jesus.

16:27.863 --> 16:33.158
- I'll be down in Maintenance, OK?
- Al?

16:33.326 --> 16:38.455
Remember you sent some wildcatters
out into the middle of nowhere last week?

16:38.623 --> 16:42.751
One of them's on the horn,
says he's onto something.

16:42.919 --> 16:46.380
- Wants to know if his claim will be honored.
- Why wouldn't it be?

16:46.548 --> 16:50.259
Because you sent them out there
on company orders maybe?

16:50.427 --> 16:55.431
Christ! Some honch in a cushy office
on Earth says go look at a grid reference.

16:55.599 --> 16:58.767
We look. They don't say why,
and I don't ask,

16:58.935 --> 17:01.729
because it takes two weeks
to get an answer,

17:01.897 --> 17:04.231
and the answer is always "Don't ask."

17:04.399 --> 17:06.483
So what do I tell this guy?

17:06.651 --> 17:10.487
As far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.115
- Lydecker?
- What?

17:13.283 --> 17:18.329
You kids know you're not supposed
to be on this level. Get outta here.

17:49.069 --> 17:54.323
- You go in places we can't fit.
- That's why I'm the best.

17:54.491 --> 17:59.119
Knock it off. I catch you playing
in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.497
- All the kids...
- I don't care.

18:01.665 --> 18:04.124
Wait a minute. Annie, look at this.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.846
Folks, we have scored big this time.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.855
What is it, Dad?

18:30.402 --> 18:37.199
I'm not sure. Let's try and get a closer look
at it through that crack down the side.

18:37.367 --> 18:41.495
- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.

18:45.959 --> 18:51.380
That's about as close as we can get.
Shall we take a look inside?

19:06.312 --> 19:09.398
You kids stay inside.
We'll be right back.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.567
OK. Bye.

20:29.521 --> 20:32.648
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.943
It'll be OK, Newt.
Dad knows what he's doing.

20:37.237 --> 20:44.118
Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Nine calling Hadley Control!

21:30.081 --> 21:35.502
Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps...

21:35.670 --> 21:37.880
We have to talk.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.967
We've lost contact
with the colony on LV-426.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.392
I don't believe this.

21:50.560 --> 21:55.063
You throw me at the wolves,
and now you want me to go back out there?

21:55.231 --> 21:57.816
Forget it. It's not my problem.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.361
- Can I finish?
- There's no way.

22:02.864 --> 22:07.534
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.
I guarantee your safety.

22:07.702 --> 22:10.746
These Colonial Marines
are very tough hombres.

22:10.914 --> 22:15.375
They pack state-of-the-art firepower.
There's nothing they can't handle.

22:15.627 --> 22:20.255
- Lieutenant, am I right?
- We're trained to deal with these situations.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.341
Then you don't need me.
I'm not a soldier.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.428
We don't know
what's going on out there.

22:26.596 --> 22:30.599
It may just be a downed transmitter, okay?
But if it's not,

22:30.767 --> 22:34.770
I would like you there as an adviser,
and that's all.

22:37.941 --> 22:41.944
What's your interest in this?
Why are you going?

22:42.111 --> 22:46.406
The corporation co-financed that colony
with Colonial Administration.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.785
We're into a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds...

22:49.953 --> 22:55.040
Yeah, I saw the commercial.
I've gotta get to work.

22:56.167 --> 22:59.086
I heard you're working
in the cargo docks.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.295
That's right.

23:00.463 --> 23:03.131
- Running forklifts?
- So?

23:03.299 --> 23:06.426
Nothing. It's great
that you're keeping busy.

23:06.594 --> 23:12.057
And I know it's the only thing you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.

23:14.143 --> 23:18.063
What if I told you I could
get you reinstated as a flight officer?

23:18.231 --> 23:22.067
The company's agreed
to pick up your contract.

23:22.235 --> 23:24.277
If I go.

23:25.321 --> 23:29.116
If you go. Come on.
That's a second chance, kiddo.

23:29.283 --> 23:34.162
I think for you it would be best
to face this thing, get back on the horse...

23:34.330 --> 23:37.332
Spare me. I've had
my psych evaluation this month.

23:37.500 --> 23:41.503
I know. l read it. You wake up every night
soaking with sweat...

23:41.671 --> 23:43.839
I said no, and I mean it.

23:46.801 --> 23:53.015
Now please leave. I am not going back,
and I would be no good to you if I did.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.100
OK.

23:57.520 --> 24:01.023
Would you do me a favor?
Just think about it.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.319
Thanks for the coffee.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.348
Hello?

25:19.102 --> 25:22.604
- You OK?
- Just tell me one thing.

25:22.772 --> 25:25.941
You're going out there
to destroy them, right?

25:26.109 --> 25:31.071
Not to study, not to bring back,
but to wipe them out.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.117
That's the plan. You have my word on it.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.621
All right, I'm in.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.424
And you, you little shithead,

25:52.969 --> 25:55.846
you're staying here.

28:26.455 --> 28:30.375
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

28:30.543 --> 28:33.420
Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.

28:33.587 --> 28:34.629
What?

28:34.880 --> 28:35.964
Is that a joke?

28:36.132 --> 28:38.258
I wish it were.

28:38.426 --> 28:43.263
Hey, Hicks. You look just like I feel.

28:45.433 --> 28:48.768
OK, sweethearts, what are you waiting for?
Breakfast in bed?

28:48.936 --> 28:54.107
Another glorious day in the Corps. A day in
the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm.

28:54.275 --> 28:59.029
Every meal's a banquet, every paycheck
a fortune, every formation a parade.

28:59.196 --> 29:03.199
- I love the Corps.
- This floor is freezing.

29:03.367 --> 29:07.829
- Want me to fetch your slippers for you?
- Gee, would you, sir?

29:07.997 --> 29:12.834
Look into my eye.
Fall in, people. Let's go.

29:13.002 --> 29:16.838
- I hate this job.
- Crowe, Wierzbowski, on your feet.

29:17.006 --> 29:19.716
You just had three weeks on your back.

29:19.884 --> 29:22.969
I'm talkin' about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

29:23.137 --> 29:25.680
Yeah, Top, how about it?

29:28.559 --> 29:32.687
First assembly's in 1 5, people. Shag it.

29:33.981 --> 29:36.566
Who's Snow White?

29:37.443 --> 29:42.363
She's some kind of consultant.
Apparently she saw an alien once.

29:42.531 --> 29:45.533
Whoopee-fucking-do. I'm impressed.

29:50.039 --> 29:54.167
Vasquez, have you
ever been mistaken for a man?

29:54.335 --> 29:56.294
No. Have you?

30:00.216 --> 30:03.510
You're just too bad.

30:11.894 --> 30:16.856
- Top, what's the op?
- It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.

30:17.024 --> 30:22.278
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

30:22.446 --> 30:25.156
Dumb-ass colonists.

30:27.576 --> 30:31.246
- What's this crap supposed to be?
- Corn bread, I think.

30:31.413 --> 30:34.249
It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

30:34.416 --> 30:38.586
I sure wouldn't mind gettin' some
more Arcturian poontang. Remember?

30:38.754 --> 30:44.092
- Yeah, Frost, but your one was male.
- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.

30:44.260 --> 30:47.053
- Bishop, do the thing with the knife.
- Oh, please.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.305
Come on.

30:49.473 --> 30:53.143
- All right!
- I don't wanna see that.

30:55.771 --> 31:01.943
What are you doin'?
Quit messin' around, Drake. Bishop!

31:02.444 --> 31:04.112
- Do it.
- Not me, man!

31:04.280 --> 31:06.614
- Yeah, you.
- Quit messin' around.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.867
Trust me.

31:22.256 --> 31:25.800
- All right, knock it off.
- Thank you.

31:29.180 --> 31:33.099
- Enjoy your meal.
- That wasn't funny.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.814
- Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?
- Thanks.

31:40.691 --> 31:46.362
Looks like the new lieutenant's
too good to eat with the rest of us grunts.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.657
The boy's got a corncob up his ass.

31:51.160 --> 31:54.996
Thought you never missed.

31:56.790 --> 32:01.294
You said nothing about
an android being on board. Why not?

32:01.462 --> 32:06.716
It never occurred to me.
We always have a synthetic on board.

32:06.884 --> 32:11.221
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

32:11.388 --> 32:16.017
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry. I don't know why I didn't...

32:16.185 --> 32:20.813
Ripley's last trip out,
the artificial person malfunctioned.

32:20.981 --> 32:24.525
There were problems,
and a few deaths were involved.

32:24.693 --> 32:29.864
- I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
- The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A/2.

32:30.032 --> 32:33.159
That explains it.
The A/2s always were a bit twitchy.

32:33.327 --> 32:36.162
That can't happen
with our behavioural inhibitors.

32:36.330 --> 32:41.668
It is impossible for me to harm,
or allow to be harmed, a human being.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.462
Sure you don't want some?

32:45.047 --> 32:49.300
Just stay away from me.
You got that?

32:50.886 --> 32:53.680
Guess she don't like
the corn bread either.

33:07.194 --> 33:11.239
- Squad, atten-ho! Officer on deck.
- As you were.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.158
Quickly. Settle down.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.369
All right, listen up.

33:17.371 --> 33:22.417
Morning, Marines. Sorry we didn't have time
to brief you before we left Gateway...

33:22.584 --> 33:25.044
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

33:25.587 --> 33:28.214
Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.386
- What's the question?
- Is this gonna be a stand-up fight,

33:33.554 --> 33:36.222
or another bug hunt?

33:36.390 --> 33:39.267
All we know is there's
no contact with the colony,

33:39.435 --> 33:42.186
and that a xenomorph may be involved.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.981
- A what?
- A xenomorph.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.275
It's a bug hunt.

33:47.443 --> 33:51.112
What exactly are we dealing with here?

33:52.072 --> 33:54.574
I'll tell you what I know.

33:54.742 --> 33:57.076
We set down on LV-426.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.620
A crew member
was brought back on board

33:59.788 --> 34:03.833
with something attached to his face,
some kind of parasite.

34:04.001 --> 34:09.213
We tried to get it off, but couldn't.
Later it seemed to come off by itself and die.

34:09.381 --> 34:14.135
Kane seemed fine.
We were all having dinner and...

34:14.303 --> 34:21.225
It must have laid something in his throat,
some sort of embryo. He started...

34:21.393 --> 34:27.482
I only need to know one thing:
where they are.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.360
- Go, Vasquez. Kick ass.
- Anytime, anywhere.

34:30.527 --> 34:35.156
Somebody said “alien”. She thought
they said “illegal alien” and signed up.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.950
- Fuck you.
- Anytime, anywhere.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.953
Are you finished?

34:45.167 --> 34:48.002
I hope you're right. l really do.

34:50.172 --> 34:56.344
OK, thank you, Ripley. We have Ripley's
report on disk. I suggest you study it.

34:56.512 --> 35:01.265
Because just one of those things wiped out
my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

35:01.433 --> 35:05.853
If the colonists found that ship, there's
no telling how many have been exposed.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.356
Do you understand?

35:10.943 --> 35:13.903
Anyway, we have it on disk,
so look at it.

35:14.071 --> 35:16.155
Any questions?

35:17.199 --> 35:21.661
- What is it, Private?
- How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

35:21.829 --> 35:24.539
You secure that shit, Hudson.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.209
All right.

35:28.377 --> 35:30.670
Now listen.

35:32.631 --> 35:37.343
I want this to go smooth,
and by the numbers.

35:37.511 --> 35:42.098
I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

35:42.266 --> 35:47.395
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
dropship prep details will have seven hours.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.564
Now move it, people.

35:49.731 --> 35:53.943
You heard the man and you know the drill.
Assholes and elbows.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.654
Hudson, come here.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.755
I don't care if you are short.
Get it done.

36:14.923 --> 36:20.261
- You'll get lip cancer smokin' those.
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed.

36:20.429 --> 36:22.972
- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.433
Take it away.

36:41.909 --> 36:44.202
Clear behind.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.877
Did you check number three?

36:53.045 --> 36:56.797
Hi. I feel like a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

36:56.965 --> 37:00.760
I don't know.
Is there anything you can do?

37:02.221 --> 37:05.431
I can drive that loader.

37:05.599 --> 37:10.436
- I have a Class 2 rating.
- Be my guest.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.651
Where you want it?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.322
Bay 1 2, please.

38:59.755 --> 39:03.257
All right. You're a team,
and there's nothing to worry about.

39:03.425 --> 39:08.387
We're gonna conquer,
and we're gonna kick some. Understood?

39:08.555 --> 39:12.266
That's what we're gonna do,
sweethearts.

39:12.434 --> 39:15.061
All right, people, on the ready line.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.562
Are you lean?

39:16.730 --> 39:18.064
Are you mean?

39:18.231 --> 39:20.733
- What are you?
- Lean, mean marines!

39:20.901 --> 39:25.279
Hudson! Get on the ready line.
Get some today!

39:25.447 --> 39:29.617
Get on the ready line!
Move it out, goddammit!

39:29.785 --> 39:33.162
Get hot! Get out, get out!

39:33.330 --> 39:36.040
Move it out, move it out!

39:41.296 --> 39:45.883
Absolutely badasses!
Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!

39:46.593 --> 39:48.344
Move it.

39:48.512 --> 39:54.141
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

39:54.309 --> 39:58.604
I want combat seating.
You know your places.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.981
Get those weapons stowed.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.485
Come on, settle down, people.

40:05.946 --> 40:10.157
- Lock 'em in, Hudson.
- Ready to get it on? You know it.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.952
OK, Bishop, let's go.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.121
Roger.

40:16.957 --> 40:19.583
I'm ready, man.

40:19.751 --> 40:23.254
Ready to get it on.

40:27.718 --> 40:31.345
Cross-locking now.
Pre-launch auto cycle engaged.

40:34.683 --> 40:38.728
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.659
Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.

40:53.827 --> 40:57.163
Affirmative. All drop stations secured.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.376
1 0 seconds.

41:06.006 --> 41:08.924
Stand by to initiate release sequencer.

41:09.092 --> 41:10.885
On my mark. Five...

41:11.052 --> 41:14.722
We're on an express elevator to hell.
Going down.

41:14.890 --> 41:17.892
..two, one, mark.

41:33.909 --> 41:36.160
Switch to DCS ranging.

41:36.328 --> 41:40.831
- 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.
- We're in the pipe. Five by five.

41:51.551 --> 41:55.221
- We're picking up some hull ionisation.
- Got it.

41:55.388 --> 41:58.599
Rough air ahead. We're in for some chop.

42:12.364 --> 42:16.784
How many drops is this for you,
Lieutenant?

42:16.952 --> 42:18.953
38.

42:20.038 --> 42:23.582
- Simulated.
- How many combat drops?

42:24.459 --> 42:27.753
Two. Including this one.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.131
- Shit.
- Oh, man.

42:44.354 --> 42:46.480
Range 014.

42:46.648 --> 42:49.149
Turning on final.

42:53.655 --> 42:57.241
- I got a bad feeling about this drop.
- You always say that.

42:57.409 --> 43:00.828
"l got a bad feeling about this drop."

43:00.996 --> 43:04.915
When we get back without ya,
I'll call your folks.

43:07.168 --> 43:11.338
All right. Let's see what we can see.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.383
Everybody online. Lookin' good.

43:16.511 --> 43:18.178
Drake, check your camera.

43:18.346 --> 43:20.180
There seems to be a malfunction.

43:20.432 --> 43:24.602
That's better. Pan it around a bit.
Good.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.896
I'm ready. Check it out.

43:27.063 --> 43:29.857
I am the ultimate badass.

43:30.025 --> 43:32.860
State-of-the-badass-art.

43:33.028 --> 43:35.529
You do not wanna fuck with me.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.699
Check it out.

43:39.701 --> 43:42.494
Ripley, don't worry.

43:42.662 --> 43:47.583
Me and my squad of ultimate badasses
will protect you.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.877
Check it out.

43:50.045 --> 43:53.547
Independently targeting
particle-beam Phalanx.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.343
Fry half a city with this puppy.

43:57.510 --> 44:02.556
We got tactical smart missiles,
phased-plasma pulse rifles, RPGs,

44:02.724 --> 44:05.726
we got sonic electronic ball breakers!

44:05.894 --> 44:09.229
We got nukes, we got knives,
sharp sticks...

44:09.397 --> 44:10.439
Knock it off.

44:10.607 --> 44:12.232
All right, gear up.

44:12.400 --> 44:17.821
Two minutes, people.
Somebody wake up Hicks.

44:31.419 --> 44:35.464
- Coming around for a 709.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

44:35.632 --> 44:37.758
Where's the damn beacon?

44:37.926 --> 44:40.177
Oh, I see it.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.852
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- That's it.

44:49.020 --> 44:52.231
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

44:52.399 --> 44:56.110
We manufacture those, by the way.

45:05.120 --> 45:09.707
Ferro, take us in low
over the main colony complex.

45:11.501 --> 45:15.629
Storm shutters are sealed.
There's no visible activity.

45:15.797 --> 45:17.381
Hold at 40.

45:17.632 --> 45:18.674
Roger.

45:18.842 --> 45:21.593
Give me a slow circle of the complex.

45:28.309 --> 45:30.728
Structure seems intact.

45:31.771 --> 45:36.984
- They still have power.
- Ferro, set down on the landing grid.

45:37.152 --> 45:39.820
Immediate dust-off on my clear,
then stay on station.

45:54.002 --> 45:56.336
Down and clear.

45:57.839 --> 46:00.758
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.

46:02.719 --> 46:06.013
I want a nice clean dispersal this time.

46:08.183 --> 46:10.559
Let's go. Move it out.

46:10.727 --> 46:12.770
Head 'em up.

46:33.249 --> 46:37.002
First squad up online. Hicks, get yours
in a cordon. Watch the rear.

46:37.420 --> 46:40.380
Vasquez, take point. Let's move.

46:48.098 --> 46:50.224
Move up.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.896
Hudson, run a bypass.

47:00.735 --> 47:03.320
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

47:03.488 --> 47:06.115
Second squad online.

47:34.269 --> 47:36.311
Are you set?

47:39.274 --> 47:41.358
Go on.

48:06.759 --> 48:11.805
Second team, move inside.
Hicks, take the upper level.

48:38.124 --> 48:42.669
Sir, are you copying this?
Looks like hits from small-arms fire.

48:42.837 --> 48:48.175
We got some explosives damage.
It's probably seismic survey charges.

48:48.343 --> 48:52.930
Are you readin' this?
Keep it tight, people.

49:05.485 --> 49:10.864
Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

49:27.215 --> 49:29.925
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

49:36.182 --> 49:38.225
Quarter and search by twos.

49:50.238 --> 49:53.073
Dietrich, Frost, you're up.

50:39.787 --> 50:41.621
It's right in there.

50:54.135 --> 50:55.761
Now.

50:58.681 --> 51:03.643
- Good one, Hudson.
- Sir, we have a negative situation here.

51:03.811 --> 51:04.936
Moving on, sir.

51:14.405 --> 51:16.656
Wait. Tell him to...

51:17.825 --> 51:19.576
Back up.

51:19.744 --> 51:21.828
Pan right.

51:22.830 --> 51:24.664
There.

51:25.541 --> 51:28.376
You seein' this all right?

51:28.544 --> 51:34.091
Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged
one of Ripley's bad guys here.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.009
Acid for blood.

51:36.177 --> 51:39.679
If you like that, you're gonna love this.

51:52.944 --> 51:56.446
- Quit screwin' around.
- Second squad, what's your status?

51:56.614 --> 51:59.533
We've just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

51:59.700 --> 52:02.369
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

52:02.537 --> 52:06.123
Whatever happened here,
I think we missed it.

52:06.290 --> 52:09.626
The area's secured.
Let's see what their computer can tell us.

52:09.794 --> 52:12.045
- It's not secured.
- The area is secured.

52:12.213 --> 52:15.132
First team, head for Operations.

52:15.383 --> 52:17.050
Hudson, try and get their CPU online.

52:17.218 --> 52:18.343
Affirmative.

52:18.511 --> 52:21.888
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

52:22.306 --> 52:27.394
- He's comin' in. I feel safer already.
- Pendejo jerk-off.

52:47.790 --> 52:51.459
Sir, we got the CPU online. No problem.

52:51.627 --> 52:54.212
Good. Stand by in Operations.

52:55.590 --> 52:57.257
OK, let's go.

53:18.154 --> 53:20.655
Are you all right?

53:38.799 --> 53:42.677
Sir, they sealed off this wing
at both ends.

53:42.845 --> 53:47.140
Welded the doors, and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

53:47.308 --> 53:50.310
But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.

53:50.478 --> 53:52.437
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

53:52.605 --> 53:56.983
- Last stand.
- Must have been a hell of a fight.

53:57.151 --> 53:59.527
Looks that way.

54:01.614 --> 54:08.995
Drake, this way. We should be able
to cut through the medlab to Operations.

54:58.671 --> 55:00.755
Lieutenant.

55:21.819 --> 55:24.696
Are those the same ones?

55:36.250 --> 55:38.501
Careful.

55:47.970 --> 55:51.681
Looks like love at first sight to me.

55:51.849 --> 55:54.392
He likes you.

55:54.560 --> 55:57.854
Two are alive, the rest are dead.

55:58.773 --> 56:01.733
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

56:01.901 --> 56:06.571
Subject: Marachuk, John J.
Died during the procedure.

56:06.739 --> 56:08.907
They killed him taking it off.

56:13.746 --> 56:16.331
I think we got something here.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.963
- Behind us.
- One of us?

56:24.131 --> 56:27.300
Apone, where are your people?
Anybody in D-Block?

56:27.468 --> 56:31.262
Negative. We're all in Operations.

56:33.432 --> 56:35.517
Talk to me, Frosty.

56:35.684 --> 56:38.186
Just keep movin', baby.

56:55.913 --> 56:58.039
- It's moving.
- Which way?

56:58.207 --> 57:01.793
It's coming straight for us. Straight up.

57:39.290 --> 57:41.457
- Fuck.
- Hold up.

58:05.399 --> 58:07.650
It's all right. Come on.

58:07.818 --> 58:12.197
- Just grab her, Corporal.
- Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you.

58:12.865 --> 58:15.909
It's all right. Come on out.

58:16.076 --> 58:17.994
Come on. Easy...

58:18.162 --> 58:19.412
I got her.

58:19.580 --> 58:21.122
Damn!

58:21.290 --> 58:23.833
- Don't let her go.
- She's under the grille.

58:24.001 --> 58:28.421
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

58:30.174 --> 58:32.967
- Shine the light.
- Down here.

58:34.053 --> 58:36.387
- Here.
- There she is.

58:36.555 --> 58:38.431
Keep back. Don't scare her.

58:38.599 --> 58:42.101
- Grab her. We're gonna lose her.
- Damn it.

58:48.234 --> 58:50.318
Wait.

59:15.427 --> 59:18.304
It's OK. It's all right.

59:19.848 --> 59:22.141
Don't be afraid.

59:23.143 --> 59:25.186
See?

59:25.354 --> 59:27.272
Wait. No, you don't.

59:27.815 --> 59:31.150
It's OK. You're gonna be all right now.

59:33.654 --> 59:37.073
Easy, easy. It's gonna be OK.

59:37.241 --> 59:39.909
You're gonna be OK.

59:42.037 --> 59:44.956
Easy, easy.

01:00:21.452 --> 01:00:23.995
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:27.832
Think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.793
Just start at the beginning.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:33.421
Where are your parents?

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:38.676
- Look, you have to try...
- Give it a rest, why don't you?

01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:46.059
- Total brain lock.
- Physically she's OK.

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:49.228
Borderline malnutrition,
but no permanent damage.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:52.148
Come on. We're wasting our time.

01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:04.952
Try this. It's hot chocolate.

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:09.290
There you go.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.295
That good, huh?

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:27.600
I made a clean spot here. Now I've done it.
Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:40.738
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:43.366
And a pretty one, too.

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:50.832
You don't talk much, do you?

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:03.136
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Just tell me what you're scanning for.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:09.350
PDTs. Personal data transmitters.
Every colonist had one surgically implanted.

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:14.856
If they're within 20 klicks
we'll read it out here. So far, zippo.

01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:20.361
I don't know how you managed to stay alive.
But you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:24.282
Newt.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:31.497
- What'd you say?
- My name's Newt.

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:36.544
Nobody calls me Rebecca
except my brother.

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:41.340
I like that.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:44.510
I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.807
And who is this?

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:54.103
- Casey.
- Hello, Casey.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:59.358
- What about your brother? What's his name?
- Timmy.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:04.363
Is Timmy around here too,
maybe hiding like you were?

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.785
Any sisters?

01:03:13.207 --> 01:03:15.500
Mom and dad?

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:21.380
Look at me. Where are they?

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:24.592
They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.847
I'm sorry.

01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:34.393
Don't you think
you'd be safer here with us?

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:40.691
These people are here to protect you.
They're soldiers.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.694
It won't make any difference.

01:03:57.709 --> 01:04:00.002
Need anything else?

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:04.715
Hello, Bishop.
Do you need anything else?

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:15.768
- That's a nice pet you got there.
- Magnificent, isn't it?

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:20.940
Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen.
Found 'em.

01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:25.653
- They alive?
- Unknown. But it looks like all of 'em.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:32.410
Over at the processing station.
Sub-level 3, under the main cooling towers.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:38.291
- Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
- Let's saddle up, Apone.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.751
Aye, sir.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:45.131
Let's go, people. They ain't payin' us
by the hour. Head 'em out.

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:47.425
Frost, you're drivin'.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:02.148
Don't worry. It'll be OK.

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:47.526
I want a straight V deployment.
Second team on left flank.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:50.488
Advance on axial 664.

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:54.659
Tracker online.
Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient.

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:59.705
Hudson, tracker online.
Left and right, little buddy.

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:04.335
40 meters in, bearing 221 ,
there should be a stairwell.

01:06:04.503 --> 01:06:06.253
Check. Got it.

01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:10.341
You want sub-level 3.

01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:16.639
Let's go. Hudson, you got the point.
Hicks, watch our tails.

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:19.809
Nice and easy. Check those corners.

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:30.111
- Watch your spacing.
- You heard him. Don't bunch up. Stay loose.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:33.906
Your transmission's
showing a lot of break-up.

01:06:34.074 --> 01:06:38.828
- Probably interference from the structure.
- Use those lights.

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:43.916
Next one down.
Then proceed on a 21 6.

01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:46.168
Roger. That's a 21 6.

01:06:48.797 --> 01:06:51.757
I'm not making that out too well.
What is it?

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:55.136
You tell me, man. l only work here.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.652
What is that?

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.864
I don't know.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.200
Proceed inside.

01:07:33.759 --> 01:07:36.761
Watch your fire
and check your targets.

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:40.264
Remember we're looking for civvies.

01:07:49.316 --> 01:07:50.816
Easy.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:54.945
Tighten it up.
We're getting a little thin.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:57.364
Nice and easy.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:05.456
- Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
- But secreted from what?

01:08:05.624 --> 01:08:08.250
Nobody touch nothin'.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.295
Busy little creatures, huh?

01:08:12.047 --> 01:08:15.674
- Hot as hell in here.
- Yeah, but it's a dry heat.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.093
Knock it off.

01:08:25.936 --> 01:08:29.021
What do those pulse rifles fire?

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:33.526
1 0mm explosive-tip caseless.
Standard light-armor-piercing round. Why?

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:39.198
Look where your team is. They're right
under the primary heat exchangers.

01:08:39.366 --> 01:08:40.991
So?

01:08:41.159 --> 01:08:46.372
If they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.333
- She's absolutely right.
- So what?

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:56.048
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor. Right?

01:08:56.216 --> 01:09:00.803
So you're talking about a thermonuclear
explosion and "Adiós, muchachos."

01:09:00.971 --> 01:09:03.556
Great. Wonderful.

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:06.517
Shit.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:12.231
Look... Apone?

01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:20.781
We can't have any firing in there. I want
you to collect magazines from everybody.

01:09:20.949 --> 01:09:24.910
- Is he fucking crazy?
- What do we use, harsh language?

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.913
Flame units only. I want rifles slung.

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.916
Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.

01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:37.631
All right, sweethearts, you heard the man.
Come on, let's have 'em.

01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.718
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.598
Damn.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:50.811
You too. Give it up, Ski.
Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:53.063
Right on, Vas.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:58.277
Let's go, Marine.
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

01:09:58.445 --> 01:10:01.196
- Thanks a lot, sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:03.198
Head out, people.

01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:09.163
I like to keep this handy
for close encounters.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:10.831
I heard that.

01:10:20.175 --> 01:10:24.470
- Any movement?
- Nothing.

01:10:37.651 --> 01:10:39.777
Holy shit.

01:10:52.791 --> 01:10:55.000
Newt, go sit up front.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.170
Go on. Now.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:29.576
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:34.540
We're still marines, and we got a job to do.
Keep it movin'.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:37.793
Easy.

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:11.577
Top! Get over here. We got a live one.

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:15.914
- You're gonna be all right.
- Please kill me.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.751
Just stay calm. We'll get you out of here.

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:20.753
It's gonna be all right.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.130
- Oh, man.
- What is it, Dietrich?

01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:24.798
Convulsion!

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:28.177
Dietrich, get back!

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:39.646
- Flame-thrower.
- Kill it!

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:42.441
Get back. Flame-thrower. Move!

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:16.558
- Movement.
- What's the position?

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:21.230
- I can't lock in.
- Talk to me.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:25.359
Multiple signals. They're closing.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.030
Go to infrared, people. Look sharp.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:35.536
- What's happening? We can't see anything.
- Pull your team out.

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:44.419
I got readings in front and behind.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:48.507
- Where? I don't see shit.
- He's right. There's nothing back here.

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:54.429
I'm tellin' ya.
There's somethin' moving, and it ain't us.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:14:00.185
Tracker's off-scale.
They're all around us. Jesus.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:04.064
Maybe they don't show up
on infrared at all.

01:14:19.831 --> 01:14:21.874
Come on!

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:33.218
- Jesus Christ, what is going on?
- Wierzbowski and Crowe are down.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:36.221
Dietrich, Crowe, sound off.

01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:52.446
Let's rock!

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.742
Who's firing?

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:01.288
I ordered a hold fire.

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:05.626
They're coming out
of the goddamn walls!

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.756
Apone, I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:13.592
Hold your fire, goddammit.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:19.932
Apone, lay down a suppressing fire with
the incinerators and fall back by squads...

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:23.352
Say again? All after "incinerators".

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:28.607
I said lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators and fall back...

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.490
Sarge!

01:15:36.658 --> 01:15:38.951
Talk to me. Apone?

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:41.161
- Talk to me, Apone!
- He's gone!

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:47.125
- Get them out of there, now!
- Shut up!

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:50.295
- Whoever's left, get the hell out...
- Just shut up!

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:55.300
Where's Apone?

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:58.553
The sarge is gone.
Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.181
Let's go, Marines.

01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:07.604
- Hudson, look out.
- Get it!

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:15.779
- I told them to fall back.
- Fall back! Now!

01:16:15.947 --> 01:16:18.782
- I told them to fall back.
- They're cut off.

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:22.119
Do something! Fuck!

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:25.914
- Keep moving, baby.
- Hold on, Newt.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.965
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:42.556
Turn it round!

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.311
That's an order.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:55.193
- Turn this thing around.
- Get off me, damn it.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:58.071
You had your chance, Gorman.

01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:12.252
- Come on.
- Come on, Vas.

01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:32.898
Let's move it.

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:35.901
Come on, let's go.

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:39.404
It's blocked. We've got to go around.

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:41.239
Open the door.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:44.242
Drake, we are leaving!

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.495
Get them, Vas.

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:50.082
Run for it.

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:53.377
Shit.

01:17:57.799 --> 01:18:01.134
- Go.
- Drake, come on.

01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:09.726
Drake, come on.

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:21.113
- Fire in the hold.
- He's gone.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.699
- No! Drake's out there!
- Put it out.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:28.120
- Drake's coming.
- He's gone.

01:18:28.287 --> 01:18:29.955
He's not!

01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:35.127
Forget him. He's gone.

01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:42.259
Get on the goddamn door!

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.805
Eat this.

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:52.811
Go!

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:58.418
It's all right, we're clear.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:02.130
You've blown the transaxle.
You're just grinding metal.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:04.508
Come on, ease down.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:24.694
You OK?

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:30.242
Get away from me!

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:34.079
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:37.290
I don't know. Maybe a concussion.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.543
- But he's alive.
- No, he's dead!

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:45.423
- Wake up, Pendejo! Then l'm gonna kill you!
- Back off. Right now.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.137
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:58.270
Look. The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead.
Their signs were low, but they ain't dead.

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:02.357
- Then we go back and get them.
- Fuck that. I ain't going back in there.

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:05.694
You can't help them.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:11.908
You can't. Right now they're being
cocooned just like the others.

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:19.124
Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happenin'.

01:21:19.292 --> 01:21:22.127
This can't be happenin', man.

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:26.089
All right.
We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:29.467
I say we nerve-gas
the whole fuckin' nest.

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:32.679
We don't know if it's gonna affect 'em.

01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:36.808
Let's just bug out and call it even.
Why are we talking about this?

01:21:36.976 --> 01:21:41.980
I say we take off
and nuke the entire site from orbit.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:45.817
It's the only way to be sure.

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:48.528
- Fuckin' A.
- Hold on one second.

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:52.824
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:55.160
They can bill me.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:22:01.625
Look, this is an emotional moment
for all of us. I know that.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:04.336
But let's not make snap judgments.

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:07.422
This is clearly an important species,

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:12.260
and I don't think we have the right
to arbitrarily exterminate them.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.679
- Wrong.
- Yeah. Watch us.

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:17.223
Maybe you haven't kept up
on current events.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:20.518
We just got our asses kicked.

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:23.438
I'm not blind to what's going on,

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:27.192
but I cannot authorize
that kind of action. I'm sorry.

01:22:29.362 --> 01:22:34.282
I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

01:22:36.035 --> 01:22:37.702
Corporal Hicks is...?

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.039
This operation is under
military jurisdiction,

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:44.793
and Hicks is next
in chain of command, right?

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:50.090
That's right.

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:54.886
Look, this is
a multi-million-dollar installation.

01:22:55.054 --> 01:22:58.765
He can't make that kind of decision.
He's just a grunt.

01:22:58.933 --> 01:23:01.267
- No offense.
- None taken.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.561
- Ferro, do you copy?
- Standing by.

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:07.899
- Prep for dustoff. We need immediate evac.
- On our way.

01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:12.821
I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:17.075
Let's do it.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:27.711
Pick it up, Hudson.

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.219
We'll set him down here.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:44.936
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

01:23:49.442 --> 01:23:53.319
- Hold on. There's something...
- Just get up here.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.905
I'm in. Ramp closing.

01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.972
Goddammit.

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:24.893
Where the f...?

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:39.908
Run.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:24.369
That's great. That's just fuckin' great.

01:25:24.537 --> 01:25:29.249
Now what the fuck do we do?
We're in some real pretty shit now!

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:31.584
Are you finished?

01:25:34.547 --> 01:25:36.589
Are you all right?

01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:45.890
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:50.395
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be. It wasn't your fault.

01:25:50.563 --> 01:25:56.860
That's it. Game over, man.
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

01:25:57.027 --> 01:26:01.239
Maybe we could build a fire,
sing a couple of songs, huh?

01:26:01.407 --> 01:26:08.037
We'd better get back. It'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night. Mostly.

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:26.598
That's everything, right?

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:31.477
All right, this is everything
we can salvage out of the APC wreckage.

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:35.189
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:37.150
That ain't so good.

01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:40.278
We got 1 5 of these M-40 grenades.

01:26:41.322 --> 01:26:44.490
Don't touch that. Dangerous, honey.

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:49.662
- Is that the only flame-thrower?
- It's only half-full but it's functional.

01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:52.624
Got another one that's damaged.

01:26:54.752 --> 01:26:56.419
But the good news...

01:26:56.587 --> 01:26:59.464
We got four of these robot sentries,

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:02.550
with display and scanners intact.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:05.803
They really kick ass.
They'll come in handy.

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:09.432
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

01:27:12.686 --> 01:27:14.437
1 7 days.

01:27:15.648 --> 01:27:22.111
1 7 days? I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 1 7 hours.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:27.075
Those things are gonna come in here
just like before...

01:27:29.078 --> 01:27:35.291
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training. Right?

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:42.757
- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You'd better deal with it.

01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:48.680
Just deal with it, because we need you
and I'm sick of your bullshit.

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:53.184
I want you to get on a terminal
and call up a floor-plan file.

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:59.023
Construction blueprints, anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:04.028
I need to see air ducts,
electrical access tunnels, sub-basements,

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:07.865
every possible way into this complex.

01:28:08.367 --> 01:28:13.871
- We don't have much time.
- OK. I'm on it.

01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:17.709
Just relax.

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:28.011
I'll be in medlab.
Check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:30.638
Fine. You do that.

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:41.065
This service tunnel must be
how they move back and forth.

01:28:41.233 --> 01:28:48.156
That's right. It leads from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:52.827
Come down on that. OK, come over.
Go back...

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:55.580
OK, punch that in right there.

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:02.545
No. It's back here.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:07.175
There's a pressure door at this end.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:11.804
Couldn't we put a remote sentry unit
in the tunnel, then seal that door?

01:29:11.972 --> 01:29:15.141
Yeah, but we gotta figure
on them getting into the complex.

01:29:15.309 --> 01:29:20.605
That's right. So we repair the barricades
at these two intersections,

01:29:20.773 --> 01:29:26.944
and weld plate steel over these ducts
here, here and here.

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:30.114
Then they can only come at us
from these two quarters.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:35.661
Right. Then we put the other sentry units
here and here. Right?

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:38.498
- Right.
- Outstanding.

01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:41.584
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:47.715
- OK, let's move like we got a purpose.
- Affirmative.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.651
Do your thing, baby.
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:30:06.819 --> 01:30:10.655
Hudson here. A and B sentries
are in place and keyed.

01:30:10.823 --> 01:30:12.949
Arming now.

01:30:13.534 --> 01:30:16.953
- Test it, Hudson.
- Fire in the hole!

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:23.167
OK, let's get the hell outta here.

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:26.504
We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.

01:30:38.809 --> 01:30:41.060
For what it's worth.

01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:45.690
I want you to put this on.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.442
- What's it for?
- It's a locator.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:52.029
Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex on this.

01:30:53.866 --> 01:30:56.284
It's just a precaution.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:31:01.080
- Thanks.
- It doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

01:31:01.248 --> 01:31:02.874
OK, what's next?

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:34.572
Last stop.

01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:40.411
Get in.

01:31:40.579 --> 01:31:42.580
Scoot down.

01:31:43.957 --> 01:31:48.753
That's good.
Now, you have a nap. You're very tired.

01:31:48.921 --> 01:31:52.173
I don't want to sleep.
I have scary dreams.

01:31:54.635 --> 01:31:59.764
I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.
Let's take a look.

01:31:59.932 --> 01:32:02.099
Nothing bad in there.

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:06.437
See? Maybe you could
just try to be like her.

01:32:06.605 --> 01:32:12.235
She doesn't have bad dreams
because she's just a piece of plastic.

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:15.071
Right. I'm sorry.

01:32:22.496 --> 01:32:24.789
There.

01:32:24.957 --> 01:32:29.126
My mommy always said
there were no monsters, no real ones.

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:34.382
- But there are.
- Yes, there are, aren't there?

01:32:36.593 --> 01:32:38.803
Why do they tell little kids that?

01:32:40.973 --> 01:32:43.474
Most of the time it's true.

01:32:43.642 --> 01:32:47.311
Did one of those things grow inside her?

01:32:47.479 --> 01:32:51.148
I don't know. That's the truth.

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:55.820
Isn't that how babies come?
People babies?

01:32:55.988 --> 01:32:59.657
- They grow inside you.
- That's very different.

01:32:59.825 --> 01:33:04.829
- Did you ever have a baby?
- Yes, I did. I had a little girl.

01:33:04.997 --> 01:33:06.956
Where is she?

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:12.336
- She's gone.
- You mean dead.

01:33:15.007 --> 01:33:16.549
Here.

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.802
Take this.

01:33:20.554 --> 01:33:22.680
For luck.

01:33:25.809 --> 01:33:27.852
How's that?

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:35.526
- Don't go. Please.
- I'm gonna be right in the next room.

01:33:35.694 --> 01:33:38.195
And you see that camera up there?

01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:44.535
I can see you through that camera
all the time to see if you're safe.

01:33:47.706 --> 01:33:53.711
I'm not gonna leave you.
I mean that. That's a promise.

01:33:53.879 --> 01:33:56.088
You promise?

01:33:57.215 --> 01:34:00.676
- I cross my heart.
- And hope to die.

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:05.056
And hope to die.

01:34:18.278 --> 01:34:20.488
Now go to sleep.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:22.698
And don't dream.

01:34:26.912 --> 01:34:28.996
Sneak.

01:34:37.756 --> 01:34:41.801
The acid oxidises after the creature's death,
completely neutralizing.

01:34:41.968 --> 01:34:45.262
That's very interesting,
but it doesn't get us anywhere.

01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:50.267
I'm trying to figure out what we're
dealing with. Let's go through it again.

01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:56.941
They grab the colonists and immobilise them
to be hosts for more of these.

01:34:57.109 --> 01:35:00.778
Which means there would have
to be a lot of these parasites.

01:35:00.946 --> 01:35:04.949
- One for each colonist. Over 1 00 at least.
- That follows.

01:35:05.117 --> 01:35:09.286
But each of these things
comes from an egg, right?

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.541
So who's laying these eggs?

01:35:14.793 --> 01:35:18.796
I'm not sure. It must be something
we haven't seen yet.

01:35:19.464 --> 01:35:23.217
- Maybe it's like an ant hive.
- Bees. Bees have hives.

01:35:23.385 --> 01:35:27.680
You know what I mean.
One female runs the whole show.

01:35:27.848 --> 01:35:30.933
- The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

01:35:31.101 --> 01:35:35.146
- She's badass, man. I mean big.
- These things ain't ants.

01:35:35.313 --> 01:35:37.314
I know that.

01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:41.819
I want these specimens destroyed
when you're done. Is that clear?

01:35:42.988 --> 01:35:47.658
Mr. Burke wants them kept alive
for return to the company labs.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:52.997
He was very specific about it.

01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:57.376
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

01:35:57.544 --> 01:36:01.046
If you're smart,
we can both come out of this heroes,

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:03.674
and we will be set up for life.

01:36:05.135 --> 01:36:07.845
You're crazy, do you know that?

01:36:08.013 --> 01:36:12.183
You really think you can get a dangerous
organism past ICC quarantine?

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:14.977
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

01:36:15.145 --> 01:36:18.189
But they will know about it. From me.

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:22.526
Just like they'll know
you caused the deaths of 1 57 colonists.

01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:25.362
- Wait a second...
- You sent them to that ship.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:31.202
I just checked the colony log. Directive
dated 6/1 2/79, signed Burke, Carter J.

01:36:31.369 --> 01:36:34.205
You sent them out there
and didn't even warn them.

01:36:34.372 --> 01:36:36.749
Why didn't you warn them?

01:36:36.917 --> 01:36:40.127
What if that ship didn't even exist?
I didn't know.

01:36:40.295 --> 01:36:45.049
If I made a major security situation out of it,
administration steps in,

01:36:45.217 --> 01:36:47.551
and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody.

01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:53.557
So I made a decision, and it was wrong.
It was a bad call.

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:59.438
Bad call? These people are dead!
Don't you have any idea what you've done?

01:36:59.606 --> 01:37:02.316
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you to the wall.

01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:09.031
You're not gonna sleaze your way
out of this one. Right to the wall.

01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:16.914
I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:20.668
I'm happy to disappoint you.

01:37:34.432 --> 01:37:38.978
- What's goin' on?
- They're coming. In the tunnel.

01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:45.943
Here we go. A and B gun
tracking and firing. Multiple targets.

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:53.701
Look at those ammo counters go.

01:37:56.288 --> 01:37:58.455
B gun's down 50%0.

01:37:59.624 --> 01:38:03.127
Man, it's a shooting gallery down there.

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:10.801
60 rounds left on B.
40... 20... 1 0.

01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:13.137
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:16.932
1 0... 5...

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:25.357
- That's it.
- Jesus. They're wall-to-wall in there.

01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:32.114
They're at the pressure door.

01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:36.827
- Listen to that.
- Bishop here.

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:40.581
- I have some bad news.
- That's a switch.

01:38:43.001 --> 01:38:45.753
It's very pretty,
but what are we looking for?

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.340
That's it. Emergency venting.

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:54.136
That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.

01:38:54.304 --> 01:38:58.015
- How long till it blows?
- Four hours.

01:38:58.183 --> 01:39:03.896
With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
equal to about 40 megatons.

01:39:04.064 --> 01:39:07.566
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this.

01:39:07.734 --> 01:39:12.529
- Vasquez, close the shutters.
- Why can't we shut it down from here?

01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:16.950
I'm sorry. The crash caused too much
damage, and overload was inevitable.

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:21.914
Oh, man. And I was gettin' short.
Four more weeks and out.

01:39:22.082 --> 01:39:25.542
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
- Give us a break.

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:28.295
Four more weeks. Oh, man.

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:31.799
We've got to get
the other dropship from the Sulaco.

01:39:31.966 --> 01:39:34.551
There must be some way
to bring it down on remote.

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:38.222
How? The transmitter
was on the APC. It's wasted.

01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:41.975
I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something.

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:44.395
We're fucked! We're doomed!

01:39:44.562 --> 01:39:47.314
Shut up!
What about the colony transmitters?

01:39:47.482 --> 01:39:50.734
- The uplink tower at the other end.
- No, I checked.

01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:55.239
The hard wiring between here and there
was damaged. We can't align the dish.

01:39:55.407 --> 01:39:57.950
Somebody has to go out there.

01:39:58.118 --> 01:40:01.412
Take a portable terminal
and patch in manually.

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:05.916
Sure! With those things runnin' around?
You can count me out.

01:40:06.084 --> 01:40:08.919
- I guess we can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

01:40:09.087 --> 01:40:11.004
- Why don't you go?
- I'll go.

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:13.507
- What?
- I'll go.

01:40:13.675 --> 01:40:16.844
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship anyway.

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:20.764
Right, Bishop should go. Good idea.

01:40:21.391 --> 01:40:27.020
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

01:40:38.116 --> 01:40:39.616
How long?

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:43.370
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 1 80 meters.

01:40:43.538 --> 01:40:47.249
Say 40 minutes to crawl down there,

01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:51.462
an hour to patch in
and align the antenna,

01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:55.340
30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

01:40:55.508 --> 01:40:58.010
It's gonna be close.

01:41:01.681 --> 01:41:04.183
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

01:41:05.977 --> 01:41:08.520
Watch your fingers.

01:41:25.705 --> 01:41:27.706
This is unbelievable.

01:41:27.874 --> 01:41:30.375
20 meters and closing.

01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:32.461
- 1 5.
- How many?

01:41:33.004 --> 01:41:35.130
Can't tell. Lots.

01:41:36.633 --> 01:41:38.926
D gun's down 50%.

01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:44.806
C gun's right behind it.

01:41:47.018 --> 01:41:50.229
It ain't stoppin' em.

01:41:50.522 --> 01:41:52.523
1 50 rounds on D.

01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:55.943
- Come on, baby.
- 1 00 rounds.

01:41:58.947 --> 01:42:00.489
Come on!

01:42:05.078 --> 01:42:07.746
D gun's down to 20.

01:42:08.665 --> 01:42:10.707
1 0.

01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:13.335
Damn it.

01:42:15.672 --> 01:42:17.881
Wait. They're retreating.

01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:25.889
The guns stopped them.

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:29.601
You're right.

01:42:37.110 --> 01:42:41.363
- Next time they walk right up and knock.
- But they don't know that.

01:42:41.531 --> 01:42:46.785
They're probably looking for other ways
to get in. That'll take 'em a while.

01:42:46.953 --> 01:42:50.664
- Maybe we got 'em demoralised.
- Shut up.

01:42:50.832 --> 01:42:53.166
I want you two walking perimeter.

01:42:54.794 --> 01:42:56.920
Move.

01:43:03.636 --> 01:43:04.886
Listen.

01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:12.603
We're all in strung-out shape.
But stay frosty and alert.

01:43:13.605 --> 01:43:16.940
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

01:43:17.108 --> 01:43:18.817
All right.

01:43:29.829 --> 01:43:34.624
How long's it been since you got any sleep?
24 hours?

01:43:35.626 --> 01:43:41.631
I'm not gonna end up like those others.
You'll take care of it, won't you?

01:43:43.301 --> 01:43:47.804
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

01:43:49.474 --> 01:43:53.977
Let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that. All right?

01:43:56.606 --> 01:44:01.318
I wanna introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

01:44:01.486 --> 01:44:05.197
This is an M41-A pulse rifle, 1 0mm,

01:44:05.365 --> 01:44:09.826
with an over-and-under
30mm pump-action grenade launcher.

01:44:09.994 --> 01:44:12.204
Feel the weight.

01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:20.462
What do I do?

01:44:25.843 --> 01:44:28.637
Pull it in tight here.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.141
Lean into it. Now, it will kick.

01:44:33.851 --> 01:44:37.479
Right. When the counter reads zero here...

01:44:37.647 --> 01:44:40.357
- I press this up?
- That's right.

01:44:42.026 --> 01:44:45.570
And get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

01:44:45.738 --> 01:44:48.281
Now you're ready to rock'n'roll.

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:51.368
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

01:44:51.536 --> 01:44:57.874
- I don't think you wanna mess with that.
- You started this. Show me everything.

01:44:58.042 --> 01:45:00.335
I can handle myself.

01:45:01.546 --> 01:45:03.422
I noticed.

01:45:13.724 --> 01:45:17.394
- How do you feel?
- All right, I guess.

01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:20.188
One hell of a hangover.

01:45:20.773 --> 01:45:25.402
- Look, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

01:46:21.626 --> 01:46:24.586
It's OK.

01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:39.244
- Wake up.
- Wha...?

01:47:39.412 --> 01:47:42.038
Be quiet. We're in trouble.

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:05.103
Move!

01:48:36.844 --> 01:48:38.762
Help!

01:48:42.892 --> 01:48:47.937
Say again, Bishop. You've got it into
auto refuel mode, and it's sequencing right?

01:48:48.105 --> 01:48:52.275
- That's right.
- Good. Stay on it.

01:48:52.443 --> 01:48:56.988
Get back to me when
you've activated the launch cycle.

01:48:57.156 --> 01:49:00.450
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

01:49:06.749 --> 01:49:08.291
Help us!

01:49:08.459 --> 01:49:10.460
Break the glass.

01:49:10.628 --> 01:49:12.545
Break it.

01:49:12.713 --> 01:49:14.798
I'll try.

01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:39.406
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

01:49:45.037 --> 01:49:46.913
Stay here.

01:49:59.510 --> 01:50:01.678
It's the medlab.

01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:07.183
- Meet me in the medlab. We got a fire.
- We're on our way.

01:50:10.062 --> 01:50:12.355
They're coming.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:46.723
Shoot it out!

01:50:51.854 --> 01:50:53.730
Jesus!

01:50:56.233 --> 01:50:58.568
Christ, kid, look out!

01:51:19.381 --> 01:51:22.592
Over there. Ready?

01:51:28.432 --> 01:51:32.393
All clear. Nailed the other one.
It's history, man.

01:51:33.813 --> 01:51:35.605
Jesus.

01:51:38.275 --> 01:51:40.610
It was Burke.

01:51:42.655 --> 01:51:45.615
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch.

01:51:45.783 --> 01:51:49.160
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

01:51:51.622 --> 01:51:55.667
He figured he could get
an alien back through quarantine

01:51:55.835 --> 01:51:58.753
if one of us was impregnated...

01:51:59.755 --> 01:52:02.006
whatever you call it,

01:52:02.174 --> 01:52:04.926
and then frozen for the trip home.

01:52:05.678 --> 01:52:10.181
Nobody would know
about the embryos we were carrying.

01:52:10.349 --> 01:52:12.809
Me and Newt.

01:52:12.977 --> 01:52:14.853
We'd all know.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:22.193
He'd have to sabotage certain freezers
on the way home. Namely yours.

01:52:23.654 --> 01:52:27.490
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

01:52:27.658 --> 01:52:30.159
Fuck. He's dead.

01:52:30.703 --> 01:52:33.079
You're dog meat, pal.

01:52:34.123 --> 01:52:38.960
This is so nuts.
Listen to what you're saying.

01:52:39.128 --> 01:52:42.672
It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.

01:52:45.009 --> 01:52:49.554
- It's pathetic.
- I don't know which species is worse.

01:52:49.722 --> 01:52:54.100
You don't see them fucking each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

01:52:54.268 --> 01:52:58.479
- All right, we waste him. No offense.
- No. He's gotta go back.

01:53:00.316 --> 01:53:04.611
- They cut the power.
- How could they cut it? They're animals.

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:07.572
You two, check the corridors. Move!

01:53:07.740 --> 01:53:11.701
Gorman, watch Burke. Newt, stay close.

01:53:15.039 --> 01:53:18.207
- I'll go this side.
- You do that.

01:53:42.733 --> 01:53:44.901
- Anything?
- Somethin'.

01:53:46.403 --> 01:53:50.239
- It's inside the complex.
- You're just reading me.

01:53:51.742 --> 01:53:54.035
It ain't you.

01:53:55.079 --> 01:53:58.748
They're inside the perimeter.
They're in here.

01:53:58.916 --> 01:54:02.251
Stay cool. Vasquez?

01:54:08.801 --> 01:54:10.927
Hudson may be right.

01:54:11.428 --> 01:54:14.097
- Get back, both of you.
- The signal's weird.

01:54:15.391 --> 01:54:20.103
Must be interference or somethin'.
There's movement all over the place.

01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:22.772
Get back to Operations.

01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:24.941
It's game time.

01:54:27.569 --> 01:54:29.696
Seal the door.

01:54:29.863 --> 01:54:32.115
- Hurry.
- Come on.

01:54:32.282 --> 01:54:34.951
Come on, get back. Work fast.

01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:42.458
Cover your eyes. Don't look at the light.

01:54:42.626 --> 01:54:45.294
Movement. Signal's clean.

01:54:45.462 --> 01:54:47.463
Range 20 meters.

01:54:47.631 --> 01:54:51.801
- They've found a way in that we missed.
- We didn't miss anything.

01:54:51.969 --> 01:54:53.636
18.

01:54:54.638 --> 01:54:58.641
- 17 meters.
- Something under the floor, not in the plans.

01:54:58.809 --> 01:55:00.351
15 meters.

01:55:00.519 --> 01:55:03.980
- Definitely inside the barricades.
- Let's go.

01:55:05.607 --> 01:55:08.317
- 13 meters.
- That's right outside. Get back.

01:55:08.485 --> 01:55:12.113
- This is a big fucking signal.
- How you doing, Vasquez?

01:55:12.281 --> 01:55:14.449
Almost there.

01:55:14.992 --> 01:55:16.659
That's it.

01:55:17.619 --> 01:55:19.662
12 meters.

01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:21.164
11 ...

01:55:22.249 --> 01:55:24.417
- 10...
- Then they're right on us.

01:55:24.585 --> 01:55:27.754
- Nine meters.
- Short controlled bursts.

01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:29.297
Eight meters.

01:55:32.051 --> 01:55:33.801
Seven.

01:55:35.012 --> 01:55:37.847
- Six.
- Can't be. That's inside the room.

01:55:38.015 --> 01:55:43.519
- It's readin' right. Look.
- Well, you're not reading it right.

01:55:43.687 --> 01:55:46.522
Five meters, man. Four...

01:55:46.690 --> 01:55:48.775
What the hell?

01:55:51.487 --> 01:55:54.530
- Oh, my God...
- Give me the light.

01:56:13.050 --> 01:56:15.510
Over there! Get 'em!

01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:19.347
Come on.

01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:22.809
Do something, Gorman.

01:56:24.394 --> 01:56:27.438
Look out, there's more of 'em.

01:56:27.606 --> 01:56:30.900
Get to Medical! Do it!

01:56:31.401 --> 01:56:33.694
- Now!
- Look out, Hudson.

01:56:39.201 --> 01:56:40.326
Now.

01:56:46.333 --> 01:56:49.460
Open this door. Open it!

01:56:52.422 --> 01:56:54.757
Fall back.

01:56:59.638 --> 01:57:01.097
Die, motherfucker!

01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:10.982
Motherfucker! Come and get it, baby!

01:57:11.150 --> 01:57:15.236
I've got all day!
Come on, you bastards!

01:57:15.404 --> 01:57:19.448
You too. You want some of this?
Fuck you!

01:57:21.118 --> 01:57:22.994
Fuck you!

01:57:35.382 --> 01:57:37.842
Come on, Hicks, go.

01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:39.969
It's locked.

01:57:57.529 --> 01:57:59.697
Got it. Let's go.

01:57:59.865 --> 01:58:01.908
Go, go!

01:58:03.285 --> 01:58:04.911
Move, Gorman.

01:58:05.078 --> 01:58:07.496
Seal it.

01:58:08.832 --> 01:58:11.626
Goddamn you, open this door.

01:58:23.639 --> 01:58:25.223
- Get back.
- Hurry up.

01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:28.017
- Gorman, get out of the way.
- This way.

01:58:28.185 --> 01:58:29.852
What?

01:58:30.854 --> 01:58:36.067
- Wait. Get behind me.
- Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

01:58:38.237 --> 01:58:40.196
Come on, let's go.

01:58:42.032 --> 01:58:43.366
Move.

01:58:50.207 --> 01:58:53.876
- Which way to the landing field?
- This way.

01:58:58.257 --> 01:59:00.383
Go right.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:05.513
This way.

01:59:14.773 --> 01:59:17.608
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

01:59:18.026 --> 01:59:21.237
Bishop, do you read me? Come in.

01:59:21.405 --> 01:59:23.239
The ship is on its way.

01:59:23.407 --> 01:59:26.367
ETA 1 6 minutes.

01:59:26.535 --> 01:59:29.245
Good. Stand by there. We're on our way.

01:59:40.632 --> 01:59:44.010
- Which way now?
- That way. No, wait. This way.

01:59:44.177 --> 01:59:45.636
You sure?

01:59:47.222 --> 01:59:48.764
Move!

01:59:52.769 --> 01:59:54.895
It's just up here.

01:59:55.897 --> 01:59:59.025
- We're almost there.
- Wait.

02:00:28.930 --> 02:00:30.973
Go.

02:00:47.657 --> 02:00:51.202
Up there. There's a shortcut
across the roof.

02:01:02.798 --> 02:01:06.217
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

02:01:27.906 --> 02:01:31.117
Hicks, get her. Hurry.

02:01:36.039 --> 02:01:37.998
- Hold on.
- I'm slipping.

02:01:38.166 --> 02:01:40.209
Don't let go.

02:01:40.377 --> 02:01:42.378
- Hold on.
- Help!

02:01:42.546 --> 02:01:44.255
Got ya.

02:01:44.423 --> 02:01:46.132
I got ya.

02:01:55.058 --> 02:01:58.060
We can find her with this.

02:01:58.395 --> 02:02:02.565
Stay where you are. We're coming.

02:02:20.375 --> 02:02:22.668
This way.

02:02:23.712 --> 02:02:25.588
She's close.

02:02:32.179 --> 02:02:34.430
Where are you? Can you hear me?

02:02:36.391 --> 02:02:40.060
- I'm here.
- Where?

02:02:45.066 --> 02:02:47.109
Are you OK?

02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:50.946
- We need to cut it.
- Climb down, honey.

02:02:51.114 --> 02:02:53.491
We've gotta cut through.

02:03:03.293 --> 02:03:05.961
Don't move. Stay very still.

02:03:08.131 --> 02:03:10.841
We're almost there. Hang in there.

02:03:18.642 --> 02:03:21.352
- I know.
- Hurry. I mean it.

02:03:35.992 --> 02:03:38.661
Newt, just stay still.

02:03:43.458 --> 02:03:46.126
Almost there.

02:04:03.853 --> 02:04:05.896
Let's go.

02:04:06.064 --> 02:04:09.400
They don't kill you, they...

02:04:09.568 --> 02:04:12.361
- She's alive!
- All right!

02:04:12.529 --> 02:04:16.657
I believe you. She's alive.
We've gotta go. Now!

02:04:49.733 --> 02:04:51.859
Get it off.

02:05:02.245 --> 02:05:04.079
Here.

02:05:08.418 --> 02:05:10.461
Go.

02:05:12.756 --> 02:05:15.257
You can make it.

02:05:39.074 --> 02:05:43.619
- Bishop, how much time?
- Plenty. 26 minutes.

02:05:43.787 --> 02:05:47.122
- We're not leaving.
- We're not?

02:07:12.333 --> 02:07:15.794
I don't wanna hear it.
She's alive. There's still time.

02:07:15.962 --> 02:07:18.380
In 1 9 minutes,
this area's gonna be a vapor cloud.

02:07:18.548 --> 02:07:20.966
- Don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

02:07:24.888 --> 02:07:27.473
- See you, Hicks.
- Dwayne.

02:07:28.683 --> 02:07:30.350
It's Dwayne.

02:07:32.228 --> 02:07:34.021
Ellen.

02:07:34.856 --> 02:07:37.733
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

02:07:45.283 --> 02:07:52.414
Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

02:07:52.582 --> 02:07:58.086
You have 1 5 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:08:44.342 --> 02:08:47.052
Attention. Emergency.

02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:51.431
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

02:08:51.599 --> 02:08:56.979
You have 14 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:12:55.885 --> 02:12:59.221
Grab on to me. Hold on.

02:16:50.619 --> 02:16:52.287
Let's go.

02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:57.667
Behind us.

02:18:03.984 --> 02:18:08.988
You have four minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:18:24.755 --> 02:18:27.507
Come on, goddammit!

02:18:33.556 --> 02:18:36.266
Hold on to me.

02:19:31.071 --> 02:19:35.783
You have two minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:19:48.464 --> 02:19:51.299
Bishop, goddamn you!

02:20:55.155 --> 02:20:57.198
Close your eyes, baby.

02:20:59.535 --> 02:21:01.786
Look!

02:21:08.794 --> 02:21:10.670
Come on.

02:21:39.450 --> 02:21:41.701
Punch it.

02:22:27.414 --> 02:22:29.457
We're OK.

02:22:42.137 --> 02:22:44.305
We made it.

02:22:44.473 --> 02:22:46.766
I knew you'd come.

02:23:01.657 --> 02:23:07.161
He'll be all right. He's just out.
I had to give him another shot for the pain.

02:23:07.329 --> 02:23:11.290
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to Medical.

02:23:17.631 --> 02:23:21.551
Sorry if I scared you.
That platform was becoming too unstable.

02:23:21.719 --> 02:23:26.305
I had to hope
things didn't get too rough to take you off.

02:23:27.516 --> 02:23:30.184
- You did OK.
- I did?

02:24:11.226 --> 02:24:13.186
Go. Move.

02:24:15.898 --> 02:24:18.775
No, here!

02:24:20.235 --> 02:24:21.611
Run.

02:24:26.116 --> 02:24:27.742
Here.

02:25:56.456 --> 02:25:58.749
Get away from her, you bitch!

02:26:21.857 --> 02:26:24.400
Come on!

02:29:55.737 --> 02:29:58.030
- Mommy.
- Oh, God...

02:30:01.576 --> 02:30:04.829
Not bad for a human.

02:30:52.085 --> 02:30:54.962
Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

02:30:55.297 --> 02:30:57.965
- All the way home.
- Can I dream?

02:31:00.135 --> 02:31:02.928
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

02:31:11.062 --> 02:31:13.814
- Sleep tight.
- Affirmative.

02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:23.670
[ENGLISH - US]

02:34:29.469 --> 02:34:31.178
Come here.

02:34:37.685 --> 02:34:39.686
It's all right.

02:34:44.692 --> 02:34:46.568
It's over.

02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:57.830
I don't understand this.

02:34:57.997 --> 02:35:01.125
We have been here
for three and a half hours.

02:35:01.292 --> 02:35:04.044
How many different ways
do you want me to tell the same story?

02:35:17.851 --> 02:35:21.061
That could have been better.
Look, I think...

02:35:21.229 --> 02:35:23.397
Van Leuwen?

02:35:23.565 --> 02:35:26.900
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

02:35:27.068 --> 02:35:30.737
I don't have to.
There have been people there over 20 years,

02:35:30.905 --> 02:35:33.949
and they never mentioned
hostile organisms.

02:35:34.117 --> 02:35:36.994
- What people?
- Terraformers.

02:35:37.162 --> 02:35:42.749
Planet engineers. They set up big atmosphere
processors to make the air breathable.

02:35:42.917 --> 02:35:47.212
Takes decades. It's what we call
a "shake'n'bake" colony.

02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:50.924
How many colonists are there?

02:35:51.593 --> 02:35:55.470
60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?

02:35:58.141 --> 02:36:00.267
Families.

02:36:02.604 --> 02:36:04.396
Jesus.

02:36:29.631 --> 02:36:34.176
- Lieutenant, am I right?
- We're trained to deal with these situations.

02:36:34.344 --> 02:36:36.303
Then you don't need me.

02:36:37.931 --> 02:36:40.390
We don't know
what's going on out there.

02:36:40.558 --> 02:36:44.519
It may just be a downed transmitter, okay?
But if it's not,

02:36:44.687 --> 02:36:48.732
I would like you there as an adviser,
and that's all.

02:36:49.984 --> 02:36:52.736
I don't have time for this.
I've gotta get to work.

02:36:54.322 --> 02:36:56.865
I heard you're working
in the cargo docks.

02:36:57.033 --> 02:36:58.075
That's right.

02:36:58.243 --> 02:37:00.911
- Running forklifts?
- So?

02:37:01.079 --> 02:37:04.206
Nothing. It's great
that you're keeping busy.

02:37:04.374 --> 02:37:09.836
And I know it's the only thing you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.

02:37:18.846 --> 02:37:21.181
And you, you little shithead,

02:37:22.767 --> 02:37:25.644
you're staying here.

02:38:48.895 --> 02:38:52.856
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

02:38:53.024 --> 02:38:55.901
Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.

02:38:56.069 --> 02:38:57.110
What?

02:38:57.361 --> 02:39:01.531
That's better. Pan it around a bit.
Good.

02:39:02.992 --> 02:39:04.576
All right, gear up.

02:39:04.744 --> 02:39:10.207
Two minutes, people.
Somebody wake up Hicks.

02:39:23.763 --> 02:39:27.849
- Coming around for a 709.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

02:39:28.017 --> 02:39:30.102
Where's the damn beacon?

02:39:30.269 --> 02:39:32.562
Oh, I see it.

02:39:37.985 --> 02:39:41.238
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- That's it.

02:39:41.405 --> 02:39:44.616
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

02:39:44.784 --> 02:39:48.453
We manufacture those, by the way.

02:39:57.463 --> 02:40:02.092
Ferro, take us in low
over the main colony complex.

02:40:03.886 --> 02:40:08.014
Storm shutters are sealed.
There's no visible activity.

02:40:08.182 --> 02:40:10.934
Hold at 40.

02:40:34.584 --> 02:40:36.293
Hudson, try and get their CPU online.

02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:37.586
Affirmative.

02:40:37.753 --> 02:40:41.089
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

02:40:41.549 --> 02:40:46.636
- He's comin' in. I feel safer already.
- Pendejo jerk-off.

02:41:05.448 --> 02:41:07.782
That's everything, right?

02:41:07.950 --> 02:41:12.662
All right, this is everything
we can salvage out of the APC wreckage.

02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:16.374
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

02:41:16.542 --> 02:41:18.335
That ain't so good.

02:41:18.502 --> 02:41:21.463
We got 1 5 of these M-40 grenades.

02:41:22.506 --> 02:41:25.675
Don't touch that. Dangerous, honey.

02:41:25.843 --> 02:41:30.847
- Is that the only flame-thrower?
- It's only half-full but it's functional.

02:41:31.015 --> 02:41:33.808
Got another one that's damaged.

02:41:35.436 --> 02:41:38.897
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

02:41:42.151 --> 02:41:43.902
1 7 days.

02:41:45.112 --> 02:41:51.576
1 7 days? I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 1 7 hours.

02:41:52.161 --> 02:41:56.539
Those things are gonna come in here
just like before...

02:41:58.542 --> 02:42:04.756
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training. Right?

02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:12.222
- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You'd better deal with it.

02:42:12.390 --> 02:42:18.144
Just deal with it, because we need you
and I'm sick of your bullshit.

02:42:18.312 --> 02:42:22.649
I want you to get on a terminal
and call up a floor-plan file.

02:42:22.817 --> 02:42:28.488
Construction blueprints, anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

02:42:28.656 --> 02:42:33.493
I need to see air ducts,
electrical access tunnels, sub-basements,

02:42:33.661 --> 02:42:37.330
every possible way into this complex.

02:42:37.832 --> 02:42:43.336
- We don't have much time.
- OK. I'm on it.

02:42:44.714 --> 02:42:47.173
Just relax.

02:42:52.638 --> 02:42:57.475
I'll be in medlab.
Check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

02:42:57.643 --> 02:43:00.103
Fine. You do that.

02:43:07.236 --> 02:43:10.530
This service tunnel must be
how they move back and forth.

02:43:10.698 --> 02:43:17.620
That's right. It leads from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

02:43:17.788 --> 02:43:22.292
Come down on that. OK, come over.
Go back...

02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:25.045
OK, punch that in right there.

02:43:30.009 --> 02:43:32.010
No. It's back here.

02:43:33.888 --> 02:43:36.222
There's a pressure door at this end.

02:43:36.390 --> 02:43:39.934
We could weld it shut.
That should hold them for a while.

02:43:40.102 --> 02:43:42.395
But we gotta figure
on them getting into the complex.

02:43:42.563 --> 02:43:47.817
That's right. So we repair the barricades
at these two intersections,

02:43:47.985 --> 02:43:53.865
and weld plate steel over these ducts
here, here and here.

02:43:54.033 --> 02:43:56.576
That should seal off Medlab and Operations.

02:43:56.786 --> 02:43:58.661
Outstanding.

02:43:58.829 --> 02:44:00.580
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.796
- OK, let's move like we got a purpose.
- Affirmative.

02:44:10.091 --> 02:44:13.259
We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.

02:44:25.940 --> 02:44:28.191
For what it's worth.

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:32.779
I want you to put this on.

02:44:33.531 --> 02:44:35.573
- What's it for?
- It's a locator.

02:44:35.741 --> 02:44:39.160
Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex on this.

02:44:40.955 --> 02:44:43.414
It's just a precaution.

02:44:43.582 --> 02:44:48.211
- Thanks.
- It doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

02:44:48.379 --> 02:44:50.004
OK, what's next?

02:45:07.398 --> 02:45:09.482
Last stop.

02:45:13.612 --> 02:45:15.280
Get in.

02:45:15.447 --> 02:45:17.490
Scoot down.

02:45:18.826 --> 02:45:23.621
That's good.
Now, you have a nap. You're very tired.

02:45:23.789 --> 02:45:27.041
I don't want to sleep.
I have scary dreams.

02:45:29.503 --> 02:45:34.674
I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.
Let's take a look.

02:45:34.842 --> 02:45:37.010
Nothing bad in there.

02:45:37.178 --> 02:45:41.347
See? Maybe you could
just try to be like her.

02:45:41.515 --> 02:45:47.103
She doesn't have bad dreams
because she's just a piece of plastic.

02:45:47.271 --> 02:45:49.939
Right. I'm sorry.

02:45:57.364 --> 02:45:59.699
There.

02:45:59.867 --> 02:46:04.037
My mommy always said
there were no monsters, no real ones.

02:46:04.205 --> 02:46:09.250
- But there are.
- Yes, there are, aren't there?

02:46:11.462 --> 02:46:13.713
Why do they tell little kids that?

02:46:15.883 --> 02:46:18.384
Most of the time it's true.

02:46:21.138 --> 02:46:22.722
Here.

02:46:23.599 --> 02:46:27.685
The acid oxidizes after the creature's death,
completely neutralizing.

02:46:27.853 --> 02:46:31.147
That's very interesting,
but it doesn't get us anywhere.

02:46:31.315 --> 02:46:36.152
I'm trying to figure out what we're
dealing with. Let's go through it again.

02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:42.784
They grab the colonists and immobilize them
to be hosts for more of these.

02:46:42.952 --> 02:46:46.663
Which means there would have
to be a lot of these parasites.

02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:50.833
- One for each colonist. Over 1 00 at least.
- That follows.

02:46:51.001 --> 02:46:55.129
But each of these things
comes from an egg, right?

02:46:57.883 --> 02:46:59.384
So who's laying these eggs?

02:47:00.636 --> 02:47:04.681
I'm not sure. It must be something
we haven't seen yet.

02:47:09.353 --> 02:47:13.690
I want these specimens destroyed
when you're done. Is that clear?

02:47:14.858 --> 02:47:19.529
Mr. Burke wants them kept alive
for return to the company labs.

02:47:22.574 --> 02:47:24.909
He was very specific about it.

02:47:27.329 --> 02:47:32.208
I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

02:47:33.419 --> 02:47:35.962
I'm happy to disappoint you.

02:47:49.727 --> 02:47:52.061
I want you two walking perimeter.

02:47:52.730 --> 02:47:53.980
Listen.

02:47:55.065 --> 02:48:01.738
We're all in strung-out shape.
But stay frosty and alert.

02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:06.075
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

02:48:06.243 --> 02:48:07.910
All right.

02:48:46.825 --> 02:48:50.286
I don't wanna hear it.
She's alive. There's still time.

02:48:50.454 --> 02:48:52.830
In 1 9 minutes,
this area's gonna be a vapor cloud.

02:48:52.998 --> 02:48:55.458
- Don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

02:49:00.005 --> 02:49:07.136
Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

02:49:07.304 --> 02:49:12.850
You have 1 5 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:49:16.396 --> 02:49:19.148
- Sleep tight.
- Affirmative.

02:52:28.130 --> 02:52:29.130
