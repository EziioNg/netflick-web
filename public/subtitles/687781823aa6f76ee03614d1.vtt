WEBVTT

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:04.221
Bio-readouts are in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.726
There goes our salvage.

00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:39.297
- How are we today?
- Terrible.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:43.510
- Better than yesterday, at least.
- Where am I?

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:47.556
You're safe. You're at Gateway Station,
been here two days.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:51.268
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.187
Looks like you've got a visitor.

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.941
Jonesy. Come here.

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.111
Come here.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:06.533
How are you, you stupid cat?
Where have you been?

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:11.413
I guess you two have met.
I'm Carter Burke.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.460
I work for the company.
But don't let that fool you. I'm an OK guy.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:23.133
I'm glad you're a little better. The weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.097
It's just natural side effects
of such an unusually long hypersleep.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:33.810
What do you mean?
How long was I out there?

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:39.149
Has no one discussed this with you yet?

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:43.820
But, I mean, I don't recognize this place.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.157
No, I know.

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:50.827
It's just that this might be a shock.
It's longer...

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.164
How long? Please.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.501
57 years.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.423
- What?
- You were out there for 57 years.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.677
You had drifted
right through the core systems,

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:13.683
and it's really just blind luck
that a deep-salvage team found you.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.355
It's one in a thousand, really.
You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:22.025
You could be floating out there forever.

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:24.235
Are you OK?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.872
Are you OK?

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.549
God!

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.219
Nurse!

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.264
Someone get in here now.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.392
Now!

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.727
- Hold.
- Please...

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.021
Hold her.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.233
Kill me!

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:24.421
Bad dreams again?
Want something to help you sleep?

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.007
I've slept enough.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.054
Come here.

00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.563
It's all right.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.445
It's over.

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:19.225
- Sorry I'm late.
- Is there any word about my daughter?

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:23.980
I think we should worry about the hearing
now, cos we don't have long.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:28.151
I read your deposition, and it's great.
Stick to that and we'll be fine.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.987
There'll be a lot of heavyweights there -

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:36.493
feds, Interstellar Commerce Commission,
Colonial Administration, insurance guys...

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.329
Do you have any news
about my daughter?

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:45.001
We did come up with some information.
Why don't we sit down?

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:49.172
I was hoping to wait
until after the inquest...

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:58.681
Amanda Ripley-McClaren -
married name, I guess - aged 66.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.268
And that was at the time of her death.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.313
Which was two years ago.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.150
I'm real sorry.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.121
Amy...

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:27.544
She was interred at Westlake Repository,
Little Chute, Wisconsin.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.421
No children. I checked.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:39.806
I promised her
that I'd be home for her birthday.

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.895
Her 11th birthday.

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:59.075
I don't understand this.

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:02.412
We have been here
for three and a half hours.

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:05.290
How many different ways
do you want me to tell the same story?

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:10.044
Look at it from our perspective, please.

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.255
Please.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:19.929
You admit to destroying
an M-Class star-freighter,

00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:22.432
a rather expensive piece of hardware.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:28.605
42 million in adjusted dollars.
That's minus payload, of course.

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:33.109
The lifeboat's flight recorder
corroborates some of your account,

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:38.281
in that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426,

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:41.451
an unsurveyed planet at that time.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:46.372
That it resumed its course and was
subsequently set for self-destruct, by you,

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:50.376
- for reasons unknown.
- Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:56.132
We landed there on company orders
to get this thing, which destroyed my crew.

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.635
And your expensive ship.

00:11:58.801 --> 00:12:02.472
The analysis team,
which examined the lifeboat minutely,

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.308
found no evidence of this creature.

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:10.438
Good. That's because I blew it
out of the goddamn airlock.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.566
Like I said.

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.822
Are there any species
like this hostile organism on LV-4267

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:23.534
It's a rock. No indigenous life.

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:27.997
Did IQs drop sharply while I was away?

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:33.336
I said it was not indigenous.
It was a derelict spacecraft, an alien ship.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:38.007
It was not from there. Do you get it?
We homed in on its beacon.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:44.472
And found something never recorded once
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:50.687
"A creature that gestates inside a living
human host." These are your words.

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:55.525
- "And has concentrated acid for blood."
- That's right.

00:12:55.692 --> 00:13:02.198
I can see where this is going.
But I'm telling you that those things exist.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:05.493
- Thank you. That will be all.
- Please!

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.829
Kane, the crew member...

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:12.375
Kane, who went into that ship,
said he saw thousands of eggs there.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:16.212
- Thank you, that will be all.
- Goddammit, that's not all.

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:19.007
If one of those things gets down here,

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:24.721
you can kiss all of this bullshit goodbye!

00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:39.736
It is the finding of this court of inquiry
that Warrant Officer E Ripley, NOC 14472,

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:43.197
has acted with questionable judgment,

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:48.870
and is unfit to hold an ICC license
as a commercial flight officer.

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:54.042
Said license is hereby
suspended indefinitely.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:14:00.798
No criminal charges will be filed, and you
are released on your own recognizance

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:04.385
for a six-month period
of psychometric probation,

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:10.099
to include monthly review
by an ICC psychiatric technician.

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:14.020
These proceedings are closed.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:28.284
That could have been better.
Look, I think...

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.578
Van Leuwen?

00:14:30.745 --> 00:14:34.082
Why don't you just check out LV-4267

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:37.919
I don't have to.
There have been people there over 20 years,

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:41.130
and they never mentioned
hostile organisms.

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:44.175
- What people?
- Terraformers.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:49.972
Planet engineers. They set up big atmosphere
processors to make the air breathable.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:54.394
Takes decades. It's what we call
a "shake'n'bake" colony.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.106
How many colonists are there?

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:02.652
60, maybe 70 families. Do you mind?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.448
Families.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.577
Jesus.

00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:32.158
- I'll be down in Maintenance, OK?
- Al?

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:37.455
Remember you sent some wildcatters
out into the middle of nowhere last week?

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:41.751
One of them's on the horn,
says he's onto something.

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:45.379
- Wants to know if his claim will be honored.
- Why wouldn't it be?

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:49.258
Because you sent them out there
on company orders maybe?

00:16:49.425 --> 00:16:54.430
Christ! Some honch in a cushy office
on Earth says go look at a grid reference.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.767
We look. They don't say why,
and I don't ask,

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.728
because it takes two weeks
to get an answer,

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:03.231
and the answer is always "Don't ask."

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.483
So what do I tell this guy?

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.487
As far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:12.114
- Lydecker?
- What?

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:17.328
You kids know you're not supposed
to be on this level. Get outta here.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:53.322
- You go in places we can't fit.
- That's why I'm the best.

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:58.119
Knock it off. I catch you playing
in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:00.496
- All the kids...
- I don't care.

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:03.124
Wait a minute. Annie, look at this.

00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.846
Folks, we have scored big this time.

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:25.855
What is it, Dad?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:36.198
I'm not sure. Let's try and get a closer look
at it through that crack down the side.

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:40.494
- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:50.379
That's about as close as we can get.
Shall we take a look inside?

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.397
You kids stay inside.
We'll be right back.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.566
OK. Bye.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:31.647
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

00:20:31.814 --> 00:20:34.942
It'll be OK, Newt.
Dad knows what he's doing.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:43.117
Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling Hadley Control!

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:34.502
Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps...

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:36.879
We have to talk.

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:40.966
We've lost contact
with the colony on LV-426.

00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.391
I don't believe this.

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:54.063
You throw me at the wolves,
and now you want me to go back out there?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.816
Forget it. It's not my problem.

00:21:56.982 --> 00:22:00.361
- Can I finish?
- There's no way.

00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:06.534
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.
I guarantee your safety.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.745
These Colonial Marines
are very tough hombres.

00:22:09.912 --> 00:22:14.375
They pack state-of-the-art firepower.
There's nothing they can't handle.

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:19.255
- Lieutenant, am I right?
- We're trained to deal with these situations.

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:21.340
Then you don't need me.
I'm not a soldier.

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:25.427
We don't know
what's going on out there.

00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:29.598
It may just be a downed transmitter, okay?
But if it's not,

00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:33.769
I would like you there as an adviser,
and that's all.

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:40.943
What's your interest in this?
Why are you going?

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:45.406
The corporation co-financed that colony
with Colonial Administration.

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:48.784
We're into a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds...

00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:54.039
Yeah, I saw the commercial.
I've gotta get to work.

00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:58.085
I heard you're working
in the cargo docks.

00:22:58.252 --> 00:22:59.295
That's right.

00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:02.131
- Running forklifts?
- So?

00:23:02.298 --> 00:23:05.426
Nothing. It's great
that you're keeping busy.

00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:11.056
And I know it's the only thing you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.

00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:17.062
What if I told you I could
get you reinstated as a flight officer?

00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:21.066
The company's agreed
to pick up your contract.

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:23.277
If I go.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.115
If you go. Come on.
That's a second chance, kiddo.

00:23:28.282 --> 00:23:33.162
I think for you it would be best
to face this thing, get back on the horse...

00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:36.332
Spare me. I've had
my psych evaluation this month.

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:40.502
I know. I read it. You wake up every night
soaking with sweat...

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:42.838
I said no, and I mean it.

00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:52.014
Now please leave. I am not going back,
and I would be no good to you if I did.

00:23:52.473 --> 00:23:54.099
OK.

00:23:56.518 --> 00:24:00.022
Would you do me a favor?
Just think about it.

00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:05.319
Thanks for the coffee.

00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:15.347
Hello?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.603
- You OK?
- Just tell me one thing.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.940
You're going out there
to destroy them, right?

00:25:25.107 --> 00:25:30.070
Not to study, not to bring back,
but to wipe them out.

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:34.116
That's the plan. You have my word on it.

00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:38.620
All right, I'm in.

00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:50.424
And you, you little shithead,

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.845
you're staying here.

00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:29.374
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:32.419
Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.

00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:33.629
What?

00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:34.963
Is that a joke?

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.257
I wish it were.

00:28:37.424 --> 00:28:42.262
Hey, Hicks. You look just like I feel.

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:47.768
OK, sweethearts, what are you waiting for?
Breakfast in bed?

00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:53.106
Another glorious day in the Corps. A day in
the Marine Corps is like a day on the farm.

00:28:53.273 --> 00:28:58.028
Every meal's a banquet, every paycheck
a fortune, every formation a parade.

00:28:58.195 --> 00:29:02.199
- I love the Corps.
- This floor is freezing.

00:29:02.366 --> 00:29:06.828
- Want me to fetch your slippers for you?
- Gee, would you, sir?

00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:11.833
Look into my eye.
Fall in, people. Let's go.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.837
- I hate this job.
- Crowe, Wierzbowski, on your feet.

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:18.715
You just had three weeks on your back.

00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:21.969
I'm talkin' about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

00:29:22.135 --> 00:29:24.680
Yeah, Top, how about it?

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:31.687
First assembly's in 15, people. Shag it.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.565
Who's Snow White?

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:41.363
She's some kind of consultant.
Apparently she saw an alien once.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:44.533
Whoopee-fucking-do. I'm impressed.

00:29:49.037 --> 00:29:53.166
Vasquez, have you
ever been mistaken for a man?

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:55.294
No. Have you?

00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:02.509
You're just too bad.

00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:15.856
- Top, what's the op?
- It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.

00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:21.278
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:24.156
Dumb-ass colonists.

00:30:26.575 --> 00:30:30.245
- What's this crap supposed to be?
- Corn bread, I think.

00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:33.248
It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:37.586
I sure wouldn't mind gettin' some
more Arcturian poontang. Remember?

00:30:37.753 --> 00:30:43.091
- Yeah, Frost, but your one was male.
- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian.

00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:46.053
- Bishop, do the thing with the knife.
- Oh, please.

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:48.305
Come on.

00:30:48.472 --> 00:30:52.142
- All right!
- I don't wanna see that.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:31:00.942
What are you doin"?
Quit messin" around, Drake. Bishop!

00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:03.111
- Do it.
- Not me, man!

00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:05.614
- Yeah, you.
- Quit messin' around.

00:31:05.781 --> 00:31:07.866
Trust me.

00:31:21.254 --> 00:31:24.800
- All right, knock it off.
- Thank you.

00:31:28.178 --> 00:31:32.099
- Enjoy your meal.
- That wasn't funny.

00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:38.814
- Lieutenant Gorman? Mr Burke?
- Thanks.

00:31:39.689 --> 00:31:45.362
Looks like the new lieutenant's
too good to eat with the rest of us grunts.

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:48.657
The boy's got a corncob up his ass.

00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:53.995
Thought you never missed.

00:31:55.789 --> 00:32:00.293
You said nothing about
an android being on board. Why not?

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:05.715
It never occurred to me.
We always have a synthetic on board.

00:32:05.882 --> 00:32:10.220
I prefer the term
“artificial person" myself.

00:32:10.387 --> 00:32:15.016
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry. I don't know why I didn't...

00:32:15.183 --> 00:32:19.813
Ripley's last trip out,
the artificial person malfunctioned.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.525
There were problems,
and a few deaths were involved.

00:32:23.692 --> 00:32:28.864
- I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
- The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A/2.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:32.159
That explains it.
The A/2s always were a bit twitchy.

00:32:32.325 --> 00:32:35.162
That can't happen
with our behavioural inhibitors.

00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:40.667
It is impossible for me to harm,
or allow to be harmed, a human being.

00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:43.462
Sure you don't want some?

00:32:44.045 --> 00:32:48.300
Just stay away from me.
You got that?

00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:52.679
Guess she don't like
the corn bread either.

00:33:06.193 --> 00:33:10.238
- Squad, atten-ho! Officer on deck.
- As you were.

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:13.158
Quickly. Settle down.

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:15.368
All right, listen up.

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:21.416
Morning, Marines. Sorry we didn't have time
to brief you before we left Gateway...

00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:24.044
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

00:33:24.586 --> 00:33:27.214
Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:32.385
- What's the question?
- Is this gonna be a stand-up fight,

00:33:32.552 --> 00:33:35.222
or another bug hunt?

00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:38.266
All we know is there's
no contact with the colony,

00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:41.186
and that a xenomorph may be involved.

00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:43.980
- A what?
- A xenomorph.

00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:46.274
It's a bug hunt.

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:50.111
What exactly are we dealing with here?

00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:53.573
I'll tell you what I know.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:56.076
We set down on LV-426.

00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:58.620
A crew member
was brought back on board

00:33:58.787 --> 00:34:02.832
with something attached to his face,
some kind of parasite.

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:08.213
We tried to get it off, but couldn't.
Later it seemed to come off by itself and die.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:13.134
Kane seemed fine.
We were all having dinner and...

00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:20.225
It must have laid something in his throat,
some sort of embryo. He started...

00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:26.481
I only need to know one thing:
where they are.

00:34:26.648 --> 00:34:29.359
- Go, Vasquez. Kick ass.
- Anytime, anywhere.

00:34:29.526 --> 00:34:34.155
Somebody said "alien". She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up.

00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:36.950
- Fuck you.
- Anytime, anywhere.

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:39.953
Are you finished?

00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:47.002
I hope you're right. I really do.

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:55.343
OK, thank you, Ripley. We have Ripley's
report on disk. I suggest you study it.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:00.265
Because just one of those things wiped out
my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

00:35:00.432 --> 00:35:04.853
If the colonists found that ship, there's
no telling how many have been exposed.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.355
Do you understand?

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:12.902
Anyway, we have it on disk,
so look at it.

00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:15.155
Any questions?

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:20.660
- What is it, Private?
- How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:23.538
You secure that shit, Hudson.

00:35:25.206 --> 00:35:27.208
All right.

00:35:27.375 --> 00:35:29.669
Now listen.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:36.343
I want this to go smooth,
and by the numbers.

00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:41.097
I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

00:35:41.264 --> 00:35:46.394
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
dropship prep details will have seven hours.

00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.563
Now move it, people.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.942
You heard the man and you know the drill.
Assholes and elbows.

00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:55.654
Hudson, come here.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.755
I don't care if you are short.
Get it done.

00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:19.260
- You'll get lip cancer smokin' those.
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed.

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:21.971
- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:24.432
Take it away.

00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:43.201
Clear behind.

00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:51.876
Did you check number three?

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:55.797
Hi. I feel like a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

00:36:55.964 --> 00:36:59.759
I don't know.
Is there anything you can do?

00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:04.431
I can drive that loader.

00:37:04.597 --> 00:37:09.436
- I have a Class 2 rating.
- Be my guest.

00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:57.650
Where you want it?

00:38:00.612 --> 00:38:02.322
Bay 12, please.

00:38:58.753 --> 00:39:02.257
All right. You're a team,
and there's nothing to worry about.

00:39:02.423 --> 00:39:07.387
We're gonna conquer,
and we're gonna kick some. Understood?

00:39:07.554 --> 00:39:11.266
That's what we're gonna do,
sweethearts.

00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:14.060
All right, people, on the ready line.

00:39:14.227 --> 00:39:15.562
Are you lean?

00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:17.063
Are you mean?

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.732
- What are you?
- Lean, mean marines!

00:39:19.899 --> 00:39:24.279
Hudson! Get on the ready line.
Get some today!

00:39:24.445 --> 00:39:28.616
Get on the ready line!
Move it out, goddammit!

00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:32.161
Get hot! Get out, get out!

00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:35.039
Move it out, move it out!

00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:44.883
Absolutely badasses!
Let's pack 'em in. Get in there!

00:39:45.592 --> 00:39:47.343
Move it.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:53.141
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:39:53.308 --> 00:39:57.604
I want combat seating.
You know your places.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.981
Get those weapons stowed.

00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:03.484
Come on, settle down, people.

00:40:04.944 --> 00:40:09.157
- Lock 'em in, Hudson.
- Ready to get it on? You know it.

00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:11.951
OK, Bishop, let's go.

00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:14.120
Roger.

00:40:15.955 --> 00:40:18.583
I'm ready, man.

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:22.253
Ready to get it on.

00:40:26.716 --> 00:40:30.345
Cross-locking now.
Pre-launch auto cycle engaged.

00:40:33.681 --> 00:40:37.727
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.659
Confirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.

00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:56.162
Affirmative. All drop stations secured.

00:40:59.832 --> 00:41:01.376
10 seconds.

00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:07.924
Stand by to initiate release sequencer.

00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:09.884
On my mark. Five...

00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:13.721
We're on an express elevator to hell.
Going down.

00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:16.891
..two, one, mark.

00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:35.159
Switch to DCS ranging.

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:39.831
- 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.
- We're in the pipe. Five by five.

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:54.220
- We're picking up some hull ionisation.
- Got it.

00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:57.598
Rough air ahead. We're in for some chop.

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:15.783
How many drops is this for you,
Lieutenant?

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:17.952
38.

00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:22.582
- Simulated.
- How many combat drops?

00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:26.753
Two. Including this one.

00:42:28.296 --> 00:42:30.131
- Shit.
- Oh, man.

00:42:43.352 --> 00:42:45.480
Range 014.

00:42:45.646 --> 00:42:48.149
Turning on final.

00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:56.240
- I got a bad feeling about this drop.
- You always say that.

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:59.827
"I got a bad feeling about this drop."

00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:03.915
When we get back without ya,
I'll call your folks.

00:43:06.167 --> 00:43:10.338
All right. Let's see what we can see.

00:43:10.505 --> 00:43:13.382
Everybody online. Lookin' good.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.178
Drake, check your camera.

00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:19.180
There seems to be a malfunction.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.601
That's better. Pan it around a bit.
Good.

00:43:23.768 --> 00:43:25.895
I'm ready. Check it out.

00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:28.856
I am the ultimate badass.

00:43:29.023 --> 00:43:31.859
State-of-the-badass-art.

00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:34.529
You do not wanna fuck with me.

00:43:35.363 --> 00:43:37.698
Check it out.

00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:41.494
Ripley, don't worry.

00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:46.582
Me and my squad of ultimate badasses
will protect you.

00:43:46.749 --> 00:43:48.876
Check it out.

00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:52.547
Independently targeting
particle-beam Phalanx.

00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:56.342
Fry half a city with this puppy.

00:43:56.509 --> 00:44:01.556
We got tactical smart missiles,
phased-plasma pulse rifles, RPGs,

00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:04.725
we got sonic electronic ballbreakers!

00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:08.229
We got nukes, we got knives,
sharp sticks...

00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:09.438
Knock it off.

00:44:09.605 --> 00:44:11.232
All right, gear up.

00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:16.821
Two minutes, people.
Somebody wake up Hicks.

00:44:30.418 --> 00:44:34.463
- Coming around for a 7009.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.757
Where's the damn beacon?

00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:39.177
Oh, I see it.

00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:47.852
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- That's it.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:51.230
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:55.109
We manufacture those, by the way.

00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:08.706
Ferro, take us in low
over the main colony complex.

00:45:10.499 --> 00:45:14.629
Storm shutters are sealed.
There's no visible activity.

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:16.380
Hold at 40.

00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:17.673
Roger.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.593
Give me a slow circle of the complex.

00:45:27.308 --> 00:45:29.727
Structure seems intact.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:35.983
- They still have power.
- Ferro, set down on the landing grid.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.819
Immediate dustoff on my clear,
then stay on station.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.336
Down and clear.

00:45:56.837 --> 00:45:59.757
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp.

00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:05.012
I want a nice clean dispersal this time.

00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:09.558
Let's go. Move it out.

00:46:09.725 --> 00:46:11.769
Head 'em up.

00:46:32.248 --> 00:46:36.002
First squad up online. Hicks, get yours
in a cordon. Watch the rear.

00:46:36.419 --> 00:46:39.380
Vasquez, take point. Let's move.

00:46:47.096 --> 00:46:49.223
Move up.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.895
Hudson, run a bypass.

00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:02.320
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:05.114
Second squad online.

00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:35.311
Are you set?

00:47:38.272 --> 00:47:40.358
Go on.

00:48:05.758 --> 00:48:10.805
Second team, move inside.
Hicks, take the upper level.

00:48:37.123 --> 00:48:41.669
Sir, are you copying this?
Looks like hits from small-arms fire.

00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:47.174
We got some explosives damage.
It's probably seismic survey charges.

00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:51.929
Are you readin' this?
Keep it tight, people.

00:49:04.483 --> 00:49:09.864
Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:28.924
Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:37.224
Quarter and search by twos.

00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:52.072
Dietrich, Frost, you're up.

00:50:38.786 --> 00:50:40.621
It's right in there.

00:50:53.133 --> 00:50:54.760
Now.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.643
- Good one, Hudson.
- Sir, we have a negative situation here.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:03.936
Moving on, sir.

00:51:13.404 --> 00:51:15.656
Wait. Tell him to...

00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:18.576
Back up.

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.828
Pan right.

00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:23.664
There.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.376
You seein' this all right?

00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:33.090
Looks melted. Somebody must have bagged
one of Ripley's bad guys here.

00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:35.009
Acid for blood.

00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:38.679
If you like that, you're gonna love this.

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:55.446
- Quit screwin' around.
- Second squad, what's your status?

00:51:55.613 --> 00:51:58.532
We've just finished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

00:51:58.699 --> 00:52:01.368
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:05.122
Whatever happened here,
I think we missed it.

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:08.626
The area's secured.
Let's see what their computer can tell us.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:11.045
- It's not secured.
- The area is secured.

00:52:11.211 --> 00:52:14.131
First team, head for Operations.

00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:16.050
Hudson, try and get their CPU online.

00:52:16.216 --> 00:52:17.343
Affirmative.

00:52:17.509 --> 00:52:20.888
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

00:52:21.305 --> 00:52:26.393
- He's comin' in. I feel safer already.
- Pendejo jerk-off.

00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:50.459
Sir, we got the CPU online. No problem.

00:52:50.626 --> 00:52:53.212
Good. Stand by in Operations.

00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:56.256
OK, let's go.

00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:19.655
Are you all right?

00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:41.677
Sir, they sealed off this wing
at both ends.

00:53:41.844 --> 00:53:46.140
Welded the doors, and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

00:53:46.306 --> 00:53:49.309
But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:51.437
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

00:53:51.603 --> 00:53:55.983
- Last stand.
- Must have been a hell of a fight.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.527
Looks that way.

00:54:00.612 --> 00:54:07.995
Drake, this way. We should be able
to cut through the medlab to Operations.

00:54:57.669 --> 00:54:59.755
Lieutenant.

00:55:20.818 --> 00:55:23.695
Are those the same ones?

00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:37.501
Careful.

00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:50.681
Looks like love at first sight to me.

00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:53.392
He likes you.

00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:56.854
Two are alive, the rest are dead.

00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:00.732
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:05.571
Subject: Marachuk, John J.
Died during the procedure.

00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:07.906
They killed him taking it off.

00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:15.330
I think we got something here.

00:56:19.918 --> 00:56:22.963
- Behind us.
- One of us?

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:26.300
Apone, where are your people?
Anybody in D-Block?

00:56:26.466 --> 00:56:30.262
Negative. We're all in Operations.

00:56:32.431 --> 00:56:34.516
Talk to me, Frosty.

00:56:34.683 --> 00:56:37.185
Just keep movin', baby.

00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:57.039
- It's moving.
- Which way?

00:56:57.205 --> 00:57:00.792
It's coming straight for us. Straight up.

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:40.457
- Fuck.
- Hold up.

00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:06.650
It's all right. Come on.

00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:11.196
- Just grab her, Corporal.
- Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you.

00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:14.908
It's all right. Come on out.

00:58:15.075 --> 00:58:16.994
Come on. Easy...

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.412
I got her.

00:58:18.578 --> 00:58:20.122
Damn!

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:22.833
- Don't let her go.
- She's under the grille.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.421
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:31.967
- Shine the light.
- Down here.

00:58:33.051 --> 00:58:35.387
- Here.
- There she is.

00:58:35.554 --> 00:58:37.431
Keep back. Don't scare her.

00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:41.101
- Grab her. We're gonna lose her.
- Damn it.

00:58:47.232 --> 00:58:49.317
Wait.

00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:17.304
It's OK. It's all right.

00:59:18.847 --> 00:59:21.141
Don't be afraid.

00:59:22.142 --> 00:59:24.186
See?

00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:26.271
Wait. No, you don't.

00:59:26.813 --> 00:59:30.150
It's OK. You're gonna be all right now.

00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:36.073
Easy, easy. It's gonna be OK.

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:38.909
You're gonna be OK.

00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:43.955
Easy, easy.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.994
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:26.832
Think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:29.793
Just start at the beginning.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.420
Where are your parents?

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:37.676
- Look, you have to try...
- Give it a rest, why don't you?

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:45.058
- Total brain lock.
- Physically she's OK.

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:48.228
Borderline malnutrition,
but no permanent damage.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:51.148
Come on. We're wasting our time.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:03.952
Try this. It's hot chocolate.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.290
There you go.

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:13.295
That good, huh?

01:01:19.593 --> 01:01:26.600
I made a clean spot here. Now I've done it.
Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

01:01:34.774 --> 01:01:39.738
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:42.365
And a pretty one, too.

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.831
You don't talk much, do you?

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:02.135
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Just tell me what you're scanning for.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:08.350
PDTs. Personal data transmitters.
Every colonist had one surgically implanted.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:13.855
If they're within 20 klicks
we'll read it out here. So far, zippo.

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:19.361
I don't know how you managed to stay alive.
But you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.281
Newt.

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:30.497
- What'd you say?
- My name's Newt.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:35.543
Nobody calls me Rebecca
except my brother.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.340
I like that.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:43.510
I'm Ripley. It's nice to meet you.

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:48.807
And who is this?

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:53.103
- Casey.
- Hello, Casey.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:58.358
- What about your brother? What's his name?
- Timmy.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:03.363
Is Timmy around here too,
maybe hiding like you were?

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.785
Any sisters?

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:14.499
Mom and dad?

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.380
Look at me. Where are they?

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:23.591
They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.847
I'm sorry.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:33.393
Don't you think
you'd be safer here with us?

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:39.691
These people are here to protect you.
They're soldiers.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:42.694
It won't make any difference.

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:59.002
Need anything else?

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.715
Hello, Bishop.
Do you need anything else?

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:14.768
- That's a nice pet you got there.
- Magnificent, isn't it?

01:04:16.478 --> 01:04:19.939
Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen.
Found 'em.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:24.652
- They alive?
- Unknown. But it looks like all of 'em.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:31.409
Over at the processing station.
Sub-level 3, under the main cooling towers.

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:37.290
- Looks like a goddamn town meeting.
- Let's saddle up, Apone.

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:39.751
Aye, sir.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:44.130
Let's go, people. They ain't payin' us
by the hour. Head 'em out.

01:04:44.297 --> 01:04:46.424
Frost, you're drivin'.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:01.147
Don't worry. It'll be OK.

01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:46.526
I want a straight V deployment.
Second team on left flank.

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.487
Advance on axial 664.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:53.658
Tracker online.
Set the V-gain to filter RF ambient.

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:58.705
Hudson, tracker online.
Left and right, little buddy.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:03.334
40 meters in, bearing 221,
there should be a stairwell.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.253
Check. Got it.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:09.340
You want sub-level 3.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:15.638
Let's go. Hudson, you got the point.
Hicks, watch our tails.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:18.808
Nice and easy. Check those corners.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:29.110
- Watch your spacing.
- You heard him. Don't bunch up. Stay loose.

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:32.906
Your transmission's
showing a lot of break-up.

01:06:33.072 --> 01:06:37.827
- Probably interference from the structure.
- Use those lights.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:42.916
Next one down.
Then proceed on a 216.

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.168
Roger. That's a 216.

01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:50.757
I'm not making that out too well.
What is it?

01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:54.135
You tell me, man. I only work here.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.652
What is that?

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:13.863
I don't know.

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:17.200
Proceed inside.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:35.760
Watch your fire
and check your targets.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:39.264
Remember we're looking for civvies.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.816
Easy.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:53.945
Tighten it up.
We're getting a little thin.

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:56.364
Nice and easy.

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:04.455
- Looks like some sort of secreted resin.
- But secreted from what?

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:07.250
Nobody touch nothin'.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:10.295
Busy little creatures, huh?

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:14.674
- Hot as hell in here.
- Yeah, but it's a dry heat.

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:17.093
Knock it off.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:28.021
What do those pulse rifles fire?

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:32.525
10mm explosive-tip caseless.
Standard light-armor-piercing round. Why?

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:38.197
Look where your team is. They're right
under the primary heat exchangers.

01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:39.991
So?

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:45.371
If they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:48.333
- She's absolutely right.
- So what?

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:55.048
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor. Right?

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:59.802
So you're talking about a thermonuclear
explosion and "Adios, muchachos."

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.555
Great. Wonderful.

01:09:03.431 --> 01:09:05.516
Shit.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.230
Look... Apone?

01:09:12.565 --> 01:09:19.781
We can't have any firing in there. I want
you to collect magazines from everybody.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:23.910
- Is he fucking crazy?
- What do we use, harsh language?

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.913
Flame units only. I want rifles slung.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.916
Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:36.631
All right, sweethearts, you heard the man.
Come on, let's have 'em.

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:39.717
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

01:09:42.762 --> 01:09:44.597
Damn.

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:49.811
You too. Give it up, Ski.
Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:52.063
Right on, Vas.

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:57.276
Let's go, Marine.
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

01:09:57.443 --> 01:10:00.196
- Thanks a lot, sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:02.198
Head out, people.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:08.162
I like to keep this handy
for close encounters.

01:10:08.329 --> 01:10:09.831
I heard that.

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:23.469
- Any movement?
- Nothing.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.776
Holy shit.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:54.000
Newt, go sit up front.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:57.170
Go on. Now.

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:28.576
Steady, people.
Let's finish our sweep.

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:33.539
We're still marines, and we got a job to do.
Keep it movin'.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.793
Easy.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:10.576
Top! Get over here. We got a live one.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:14.914
- You're gonna be all right.
- Please kill me.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.750
Just stay calm. We'll get you out of here.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:19.752
It's gonna be all right.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:22.129
- Oh, man.
- What is it, Dietrich?

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:23.798
Convulsion!

01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:27.176
Dietrich, get back!

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.646
- Flame-thrower.
- Kill it!

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:41.440
Get back. Flame-thrower. Move!

01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:15.558
- Movement.
- What's the position?

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:20.229
- I can't lock in.
- Talk to me.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:24.358
Multiple signals. They're closing.

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:29.030
Go to infrared, people. Look sharp.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:34.535
- What's happening? We can't see anything.
- Pull your team out.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:43.419
I got readings in front and behind.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:47.506
- Where? I don't see shit.
- He's right. There's nothing back here.

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:53.429
I'm tellin' ya.
There's somethin' moving, and it ain't us.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:59.185
Tracker's off-scale.
They're all around us. Jesus.

01:13:59.352 --> 01:14:03.064
Maybe they don't show up
on infrared at all.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.873
Come on!

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:32.218
- Jesus Christ, what is going on?
- Wierzbowski and Crowe are down.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.221
Dietrich, Crowe, sound off.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:51.445
Let's rock!

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.741
Who's firing?

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.287
I ordered a hold fire.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:04.625
They're coming out
of the goddamn walls!

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:09.755
Apone, I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:12.591
Hold your fire, goddammit.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:18.931
Apone, lay down a suppressing fire with
the incinerators and fall back by squads...

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:22.351
Say again? All after "incinerators".

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:27.606
I said lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators and fall back...

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.489
Sarge!

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:37.950
Talk to me. Apone?

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.161
- Talk to me, Apone!
- He's gone!

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:46.125
- Get them out of there, now!
- Shut up!

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:49.295
- Whoever's left, get the hell out...
- Just shut up!

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:54.300
Where's Apone?

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.553
The sarge is gone.
Let's get the fuck outta here!

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.181
Let's go, Marines.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.604
- Hudson, look out.
- Get it!

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:14.779
- I told them to fall back.
- Fall back! Now!

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.782
- I told them to fall back.
- They're cut off.

01:16:17.948 --> 01:16:21.118
Do something! Fuck!

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:24.914
- Keep moving, baby.
- Hold on, Newt.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:33.964
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.555
Turn it round!

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.310
That's an order.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:54.193
- Turn this thing around.
- Get off me, damn it.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.071
You had your chance, Gorman.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:11.252
- Come on.
- Come on, Vas.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.897
Let's move it.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.900
Come on, let's go.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:38.404
It's blocked. We've got to go around.

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.239
Open the door.

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:43.242
Drake, we are leaving!

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:45.494
Get them, Vas.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:49.081
Run for it.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.376
Shit.

01:17:56.797 --> 01:18:00.134
- Go.
- Drake, come on.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.726
Drake, come on.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:20.112
- Fire in the hold.
- He's gone.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:23.699
- No! Drake's out there!
- Put it out.

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:27.119
- Drake's coming.
- He's gone.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.954
He's not!

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:34.126
Forget him. He's gone.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:41.258
Get on the goddamn door!

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.804
Eat this.

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:51.810
Go!

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:57.418
It's all right, we're clear.

01:19:57.584 --> 01:20:01.130
You've blown the transaxle.
You're just grinding metal.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.507
Come on, ease down.

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:23.694
You OK?

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:29.241
Get away from me!

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:33.078
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:36.290
I don't know. Maybe a concussion.

01:20:36.457 --> 01:20:38.542
- But he's alive.
- No, he's dead!

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:44.423
- Wake up, pendejo! Then I'm gonna kill you!
- Back off. Right now.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:50.137
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:57.269
Look. The sarge and Dietrich aren't dead.
Their signs were low, but they ain't dead.

01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:01.357
- Then we go back and get them.
- Fuck that. I ain't going back in there.

01:21:01.523 --> 01:21:04.693
You can't help them.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:10.908
You can't. Right now they're being
cocooned just like the others.

01:21:13.911 --> 01:21:18.123
Dear Lord Jesus, this ain't happenin'.

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:21.126
This can't be happenin', man.

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:25.089
All right.
We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:28.467
I say we nerve-gas
the whole fuckin' nest.

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:31.678
We don't know if it's gonna affect 'em.

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:35.808
Let's just bug out and call it even.
Why are we talking about this?

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:40.979
I say we take off
and nuke the entire site from orbit.

01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.817
It's the only way to be sure.

01:21:44.983 --> 01:21:47.528
- Fuckin' A.
- Hold on one second.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:51.824
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:54.159
They can bill me.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:22:00.624
Look, this is an emotional moment
for all of us. I know that.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:03.335
But let's not make snap judgments.

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:06.422
This is clearly an important species,

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:11.260
and I don't think we have the right
to arbitrarily exterminate them.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.679
- Wrong.
- Yeah. Watch us.

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:16.223
Maybe you haven't kept up
on current events.

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.518
We just got our asses kicked.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:22.438
I'm not blind to what's going on,

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:26.191
but I cannot authorize
that kind of action. I'm sorry.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:33.282
I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.702
Corporal Hicks is...?

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:40.038
This operation is under
military jurisdiction,

01:22:40.205 --> 01:22:43.792
and Hicks is next
in chain of command, right?

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:49.089
That's right.

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:53.886
Look, this is
a multi-million-dollar installation.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:57.764
He can't make that kind of decision.
He's just a grunt.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:00.267
- No offense.
- None taken.

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:02.561
- Ferro, do you copy?
- Standing by.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:06.899
- Prep for dustoff. We need immediate evac.
- On our way.

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:11.820
I say we take off, nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.074
Let's do it.

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:26.710
Pick it up, Hudson.

01:23:32.216 --> 01:23:35.219
We'll set him down here.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:43.936
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:52.319
- Hold on. There's something...
- Just get up here.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.905
I'm in. Ramp closing.

01:24:17.886 --> 01:24:19.972
Goddammit.

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:23.892
Where the f...?

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.907
Run.

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:23.368
That's great. That's just fuckin' great.

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:28.248
Now what the fuck do we do?
We're in some real pretty shit now!

01:25:28.415 --> 01:25:30.584
Are you finished?

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.589
Are you all right?

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:44.890
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:49.394
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be. It wasn't your fault.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:55.859
That's it. Game over, man.
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

01:25:56.026 --> 01:26:00.238
Maybe we could build a fire,
sing a couple of songs, huh?

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:07.037
We'd better get back. It'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night. Mostly.

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.597
That's everything, right?

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:30.477
All right, this is everything
we can salvage out of the APC wreckage.

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:34.189
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.149
That ain't so good.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:39.277
We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.490
Don't touch that. Dangerous, honey.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:48.662
- Is that the only flame-thrower?
- It's only half-full but it's functional.

01:26:48.829 --> 01:26:51.623
Got another one that's damaged.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.419
But the good news...

01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:58.463
We got four of these robot sentries,

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:01.550
with display and scanners intact.

01:27:01.717 --> 01:27:04.803
They really kick ass.
They'll come in handy.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:08.432
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:13.437
17 days.

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:21.111
17 days? I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours.

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:26.074
Those things are gonna come in here
just like before...

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:34.291
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training. Right?

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:41.757
- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You'd better deal with it.

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:47.679
Just deal with it, because we need you
and I'm sick of your bullshit.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:52.184
I want you to get on a terminal
and call up a floor-plan file.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:58.023
Construction blueprints, anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:03.028
I need to see air ducts,
electrical access tunnels, sub-basements,

01:28:03.195 --> 01:28:06.865
every possible way into this complex.

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:12.871
- We don't have much time.
- OK. I'm on it.

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:16.708
Just relax.

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:27.010
I'll be in medlab.
Check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:29.638
Fine. You do that.

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:40.065
This service tunnel must be
how they move back and forth.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:47.155
That's right. It leads from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:51.827
Come down on that. OK, come over.
Go back...

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.579
OK, punch that in right there.

01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:01.545
No. It's back here.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:06.174
There's a pressure door at this end.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:10.804
Couldn't we put a remote sentry unit
in the tunnel, then seal that door?

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:14.140
Yeah, but we gotta figure
on them getting into the complex.

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:19.604
That's right. So we repair the barricades
at these two intersections,

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:25.944
and weld plate steel over these ducts
here, here and here.

01:29:26.111 --> 01:29:29.114
Then they can only come at us
from these two quarters.

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:34.661
Right. Then we put the other sentry units
here and here. Right?

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:37.497
- Right.
- Outstanding.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:40.584
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:46.715
- OK, let's move like we got a purpose.
- Affirmative.

01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:05.650
Do your thing, baby.
Let's get the hell outta here.

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:09.654
Hudson here. A and B sentries
are in place and keyed.

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:11.948
Arming now.

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:15.952
- Test it, Hudson.
- Fire in the hole!

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:22.167
OK, let's get the hell outta here.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:25.503
We're sealing the tunnel. Come on, baby.

01:30:37.807 --> 01:30:40.060
For what it's worth.

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:44.689
I want you to put this on.

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:47.442
- What's it for?
- It's a locator.

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:51.029
Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex on this.

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:55.283
It's just a precaution.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:31:00.080
- Thanks.
- It doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

01:31:00.246 --> 01:31:01.873
OK, what's next?

01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:33.571
Last stop.

01:31:37.742 --> 01:31:39.411
Get in.

01:31:39.577 --> 01:31:41.579
Scoot down.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:47.752
That's good.
Now, you have a nap. You're very tired.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:51.172
I don't want to sleep.
I have scary dreams.

01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:58.763
I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.
Let's take a look.

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:01.099
Nothing bad in there.

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:05.437
See? Maybe you could
just try to be like her.

01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:11.234
She doesn't have bad dreams
because she's just a piece of plastic.

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:14.070
Right. I'm sorry.

01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:23.788
There.

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:28.126
My mommy always said
there were no monsters, no real ones.

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:33.381
- But there are.
- Yes, there are, aren't there?

01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:37.802
Why do they tell little kids that?

01:32:39.971 --> 01:32:42.474
Most of the time it's true.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.311
Did one of those things grow inside her?

01:32:46.478 --> 01:32:50.148
I don't know. That's the truth.

01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:54.819
Isn't that how babies come?
People babies?

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:58.656
- They grow inside you.
- That's very different.

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:03.828
- Did you ever have a baby?
- Yes, I did. I had a little girl.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.955
Where is she?

01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:11.336
- She's gone.
- You mean dead.

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:15.548
Here.

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:18.802
Take this.

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:21.679
For luck.

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:26.851
How's that?

01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:34.526
- Don't go. Please.
- I'm gonna be right in the next room.

01:33:34.692 --> 01:33:37.195
And you see that camera up there?

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:43.535
I can see you through that camera
all the time to see if you're safe.

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:52.710
I'm not gonna leave you.
I mean that. That's a promise.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:55.088
You promise?

01:33:56.214 --> 01:33:59.676
- I cross my heart.
- And hope to die.

01:34:01.219 --> 01:34:04.055
And hope to die.

01:34:17.277 --> 01:34:19.487
Now go to sleep.

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:21.698
And don't dream.

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:27.996
Sneak.

01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:40.800
The acid oxidises after the creature's death,
completely neutralizing.

01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:44.262
That's very interesting,
but it doesn't get us anywhere.

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:49.267
I'm trying to figure out what we're
dealing with. Let's go through it again.

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:55.940
They grab the colonists and immobilise them
to be hosts for more of these.

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:59.777
Which means there would have
to be a lot of these parasites.

01:34:59.944 --> 01:35:03.948
- One for each colonist. Over 100 at least.
- That follows.

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:08.286
But each of these things
comes from an egg, right?

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:12.540
So who's laying these eggs?

01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:17.795
I'm not sure. It must be something
we haven't seen yet.

01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:22.217
- Maybe it's like an ant hive.
- Bees. Bees have hives.

01:35:22.383 --> 01:35:26.679
You know what I mean.
One female runs the whole show.

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:29.933
- The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:34.145
- She's badass, man. I mean big.
- These things ain't ants.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:36.314
I know that.

01:35:36.481 --> 01:35:40.818
I want these specimens destroyed
when you're done. Is that clear?

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:46.658
Mr Burke wants them kept alive
for return to the company labs.

01:35:49.661 --> 01:35:51.996
He was very specific about it.

01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:56.376
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

01:35:56.542 --> 01:36:00.046
If you're smart,
we can both come out of this heroes,

01:36:00.213 --> 01:36:02.674
and we will be set up for life.

01:36:04.133 --> 01:36:06.844
You're crazy, do you know that?

01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:11.182
You really think you can get a dangerous
organism past ICC quarantine?

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:13.977
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:17.188
But they will know about it. From me.

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:21.526
Just like they'll know
you caused the deaths of 157 colonists.

01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:24.362
- Wait a second...
- You sent them to that ship.

01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:30.201
I just checked the colony log. Directive
dated 6/12/79, signed Burke, Carter J.

01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:33.204
You sent them out there
and didn't even warn them.

01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:35.748
Why didn't you warn them?

01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:39.127
What if that ship didn't even exist?
I didn't know.

01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:44.048
If I made a major security situation out of it,
administration steps in,

01:36:44.215 --> 01:36:46.551
and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody.

01:36:46.718 --> 01:36:52.557
So I made a decision, and it was wrong.
It was a bad call.

01:36:52.724 --> 01:36:58.438
Bad call? These people are dead!
Don't you have any idea what you've done?

01:36:58.604 --> 01:37:01.316
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you to the wall.

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:08.031
You're not gonna sleaze your way
out of this one. Right to the wall.

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:15.913
I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:19.667
I'm happy to disappoint you.

01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:37.977
- What's goin' on?
- They're coming. In the tunnel.

01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:44.942
Here we go. A and B gun
tracking and firing. Multiple targets.

01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:52.700
Look at those ammo counters go.

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:57.455
B gun's down 50%.

01:37:58.623 --> 01:38:02.126
Man, it's a shooting gallery down there.

01:38:04.796 --> 01:38:09.801
60 rounds left on B.
40... 20... 10.

01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:12.136
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

01:38:13.471 --> 01:38:15.932
10... 5...

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:24.357
- That's it.
- Jesus. They're wall-to-wall in there.

01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:31.114
They're at the pressure door.

01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:35.827
- Listen to that.
- Bishop here.

01:38:35.993 --> 01:38:39.580
- I have some bad news.
- That's a switch.

01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:44.752
It's very pretty,
but what are we looking for?

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:48.339
That's it. Emergency venting.

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:53.136
That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.

01:38:53.302 --> 01:38:57.014
- How long till it blows?
- Four hours.

01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:02.895
With a blast radius of 30 kilometers,
equal to about 40 megatons.

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:06.566
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this.

01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:11.529
- Vasquez, close the shutters.
- Why can't we shut it down from here?

01:39:11.696 --> 01:39:15.950
I'm sorry. The crash caused too much
damage, and overload was inevitable.

01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:20.913
Oh, man. And I was gettin' short.
Four more weeks and out.

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:24.542
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock.
- Give us a break.

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:27.295
Four more weeks. Oh, man.

01:39:27.462 --> 01:39:30.798
We've got to get
the other dropship from the Sulaco.

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:33.551
There must be some way
to bring it down on remote.

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:37.221
How? The transmitter
was on the APC. It's wasted.

01:39:37.388 --> 01:39:40.975
I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:43.394
We're fucked! We're doomed!

01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:46.314
Shut up!
What about the colony transmitters?

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:49.734
- The uplink tower at the other end.
- No, I checked.

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:54.238
The hard wiring between here and there
was damaged. We can't align the dish.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:56.949
Somebody has to go out there.

01:39:57.116 --> 01:40:00.411
Take a portable terminal
and patch in manually.

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:04.916
Sure! With those things runnin' around?
You can count me out.

01:40:05.082 --> 01:40:07.919
- I guess we can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

01:40:08.085 --> 01:40:10.004
- Why don't you go?
- I'll go.

01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:12.507
- What?
- I'll go.

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:15.843
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship anyway.

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:19.764
Right, Bishop should go. Good idea.

01:40:20.389 --> 01:40:26.020
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:38.616
How long?

01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:42.370
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 meters.

01:40:42.537 --> 01:40:46.249
Say 40 minutes to crawl down there,

01:40:46.415 --> 01:40:50.461
an hour to patch in
and align the antenna,

01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:54.340
30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

01:40:54.507 --> 01:40:57.009
It's gonna be close.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.182
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

01:41:04.976 --> 01:41:07.520
Watch your fingers.

01:41:24.704 --> 01:41:26.706
This is unbelievable.

01:41:26.872 --> 01:41:29.375
20 meters and closing.

01:41:29.542 --> 01:41:31.460
- 15.
- How many?

01:41:32.003 --> 01:41:34.130
Can't tell. Lots.

01:41:35.631 --> 01:41:37.925
D gun's down 50%.

01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:43.806
C gun's right behind it.

01:41:46.017 --> 01:41:49.228
It ain't stoppin' em.

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.522
150 rounds on D.

01:41:51.689 --> 01:41:54.942
- Come on, baby.
- 100 rounds.

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:59.488
Come on!

01:42:04.076 --> 01:42:06.746
D gun's down to 20.

01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:09.707
10.

01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:12.335
Damn it.

01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:16.881
Wait. They're retreating.

01:42:22.178 --> 01:42:24.889
The guns stopped them.

01:42:27.016 --> 01:42:28.601
You're right.

01:42:36.108 --> 01:42:40.363
- Next time they walk right up and knock.
- But they don't know that.

01:42:40.529 --> 01:42:45.785
They're probably looking for other ways
to get in. That'll take 'em a while.

01:42:45.951 --> 01:42:49.664
- Maybe we got 'em demoralised.
- Shut up.

01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.166
I want you two walking perimeter.

01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:55.920
Move.

01:43:02.635 --> 01:43:03.886
Listen.

01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:11.602
We're all in strung-out shape.
But stay frosty and alert.

01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:15.940
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:17.817
All right.

01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:33.624
How long's it been since you got any sleep?
24 hours?

01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:40.631
I'm not gonna end up like those others.
You'll take care of it, won't you?

01:43:42.299 --> 01:43:46.804
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

01:43:48.472 --> 01:43:52.977
Let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that. All right?

01:43:55.604 --> 01:44:00.317
I wanna introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

01:44:00.484 --> 01:44:04.196
This is an M41-A pulse rifle, 10mm,

01:44:04.363 --> 01:44:08.826
with an over-and-under
30mm pump-action grenade launcher.

01:44:08.993 --> 01:44:11.203
Feel the weight.

01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:19.462
What do I do?

01:44:24.842 --> 01:44:27.636
Pull it in tight here.

01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:32.141
Lean into it. Now, it will kick.

01:44:32.850 --> 01:44:36.479
Right. When the counter reads zero here...

01:44:36.645 --> 01:44:39.356
- I press this up?
- That's right.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:44.570
And get another one in quick.
Slap it in hard.

01:44:44.737 --> 01:44:47.281
Now you're ready to rock'n'roll.

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:50.367
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:56.874
- I don't think you wanna mess with that.
- You started this. Show me everything.

01:44:57.041 --> 01:44:59.335
I can handle myself.

01:45:00.544 --> 01:45:02.421
I noticed.

01:45:12.723 --> 01:45:16.393
- How do you feel?
- All right, I guess.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.188
One hell of a hangover.

01:45:19.772 --> 01:45:24.401
- Look, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

01:46:20.624 --> 01:46:23.586
It's OK.

01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:38.243
- Wake up.
- Wha...?

01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:41.038
Be quiet. We're in trouble.

01:48:02.226 --> 01:48:04.103
Move!

01:48:35.843 --> 01:48:37.761
Help!

01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:46.937
Say again, Bishop. You've got it into
auto refuel mode, and it's sequencing right?

01:48:47.104 --> 01:48:51.275
- That's right.
- Good. Stay on it.

01:48:51.442 --> 01:48:55.988
Get back to me when
you've activated the launch cycle.

01:48:56.155 --> 01:48:59.450
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

01:49:05.748 --> 01:49:07.291
Help us!

01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:09.460
Break the glass.

01:49:09.626 --> 01:49:11.545
Break it.

01:49:11.712 --> 01:49:13.797
I'll try.

01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:38.405
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

01:49:44.036 --> 01:49:45.913
Stay here.

01:49:58.509 --> 01:50:00.677
It's the medlab.

01:50:02.012 --> 01:50:06.183
- Meet me in the medlab. We got a fire.
- We're on our way.

01:50:09.061 --> 01:50:11.355
They're coming.

01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:45.722
Shoot it out!

01:50:50.853 --> 01:50:52.729
Jesus!

01:50:55.232 --> 01:50:57.568
Christ, kid, look out!

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.592
Over there. Ready?

01:51:27.431 --> 01:51:31.393
All clear. Nailed the other one.
It's history, man.

01:51:32.811 --> 01:51:34.605
Jesus.

01:51:37.274 --> 01:51:39.610
It was Burke.

01:51:41.653 --> 01:51:44.615
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch.

01:51:44.781 --> 01:51:48.160
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

01:51:50.621 --> 01:51:54.666
He figured he could get
an alien back through quarantine

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:57.753
if one of us was impregnated...

01:51:58.754 --> 01:52:01.006
whatever you call it,

01:52:01.173 --> 01:52:03.926
and then frozen for the trip home.

01:52:04.676 --> 01:52:09.181
Nobody would know
about the embryos we were carrying.

01:52:09.348 --> 01:52:11.808
Me and Newt.

01:52:11.975 --> 01:52:13.852
We'd all know.

01:52:14.019 --> 01:52:21.193
He'd have to sabotage certain freezers
on the way home. Namely yours.

01:52:22.653 --> 01:52:26.490
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:29.159
Fuck. He's dead.

01:52:29.701 --> 01:52:32.079
You're dogmeat, pal.

01:52:33.121 --> 01:52:37.960
This is so nuts.
Listen to what you're saying.

01:52:38.126 --> 01:52:41.672
It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.

01:52:44.007 --> 01:52:48.553
- It's pathetic.
- I don't know which species is worse.

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:53.100
You don't see them fucking each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

01:52:53.267 --> 01:52:57.479
- All right, we waste him. No offense.
- No. He's gotta go back.

01:52:59.314 --> 01:53:03.610
- They cut the power.
- How could they cut it? They're animals.

01:53:03.777 --> 01:53:06.571
You two, check the corridors. Move!

01:53:06.738 --> 01:53:10.701
Gorman, watch Burke. Newt, stay close.

01:53:14.037 --> 01:53:17.207
- I'll go this side.
- You do that.

01:53:41.732 --> 01:53:43.900
- Anything?
- Somethin'.

01:53:45.402 --> 01:53:49.239
- It's inside the complex.
- You're just reading me.

01:53:50.741 --> 01:53:53.035
It ain't you.

01:53:54.077 --> 01:53:57.748
They're inside the perimeter.
They're in here.

01:53:57.914 --> 01:54:01.251
Stay cool. Vasquez?

01:54:07.799 --> 01:54:09.926
Hudson may be right.

01:54:10.427 --> 01:54:13.096
- Get back, both of you.
- The signal's weird.

01:54:14.389 --> 01:54:19.102
Must be interference or somethin'.
There's movement all over the place.

01:54:19.269 --> 01:54:21.772
Get back to Operations.

01:54:21.938 --> 01:54:23.940
It's game time.

01:54:26.568 --> 01:54:28.695
Seal the door.

01:54:28.862 --> 01:54:31.114
- Hurry.
- Come on.

01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:33.950
Come on, get back. Work fast.

01:54:38.789 --> 01:54:41.458
Cover your eyes. Don't look at the light.

01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:44.294
Movement. Signal's clean.

01:54:44.461 --> 01:54:46.463
Range 20 meters.

01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:50.801
- They've found a way in that we missed.
- We didn't miss anything.

01:54:50.967 --> 01:54:52.636
18.

01:54:53.637 --> 01:54:57.641
- 17 meters.
- Something under the floor, not in the plans.

01:54:57.808 --> 01:54:59.351
15 meters.

01:54:59.518 --> 01:55:02.979
- Definitely inside the barricades.
- Let's go.

01:55:04.606 --> 01:55:07.317
- 13 meters.
- That's right outside. Get back.

01:55:07.484 --> 01:55:11.113
- This is a big fucking signal.
- How you doing, Vasquez?

01:55:11.279 --> 01:55:13.448
Almost there.

01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:15.659
That's it.

01:55:16.618 --> 01:55:18.662
12 meters.

01:55:18.829 --> 01:55:20.163
11...

01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:23.417
- 10...
- Then they're right on us.

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:26.753
- Nine meters.
- Short controlled bursts.

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:28.296
Eight meters.

01:55:31.049 --> 01:55:32.801
Seven.

01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:36.847
- Six.
- Can't be. That's inside the room.

01:55:37.013 --> 01:55:42.519
- It's readin' right. Look.
- Well, you're not reading it right.

01:55:42.686 --> 01:55:45.522
Five meters, man. Four...

01:55:45.689 --> 01:55:47.774
What the hell?

01:55:50.485 --> 01:55:53.530
- Oh, my God...
- Give me the light.

01:56:12.048 --> 01:56:14.509
Over there! Get 'em!

01:56:16.178 --> 01:56:18.346
Come on.

01:56:19.389 --> 01:56:21.808
Do something, Gorman.

01:56:23.393 --> 01:56:26.438
Look out, there's more of 'em.

01:56:26.605 --> 01:56:29.900
Get to Medical! Do it!

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.694
- Now!
- Look out, Hudson.

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:39.326
Now.

01:56:45.332 --> 01:56:48.460
Open this door. Open it!

01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:53.757
Fall back.

01:56:58.637 --> 01:57:00.096
Die, motherfucker!

01:57:05.268 --> 01:57:09.981
Motherfucker! Come and get it, baby!

01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:14.236
I've got all day!
Come on, you bastards!

01:57:14.402 --> 01:57:18.448
You too. You want some of this?
Fuck youl!

01:57:20.116 --> 01:57:21.993
Fuck youl!

01:57:34.381 --> 01:57:36.841
Come on, Hicks, go.

01:57:37.008 --> 01:57:38.969
It's locked.

01:57:56.528 --> 01:57:58.697
Got it. Let's go.

01:57:58.863 --> 01:58:00.907
Go, go!

01:58:02.284 --> 01:58:03.910
Move, Gorman.

01:58:04.077 --> 01:58:06.496
Seal it.

01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:10.625
Goddamn you, open this door.

01:58:22.637 --> 01:58:24.222
- Get back.
- Hurry up.

01:58:24.389 --> 01:58:27.017
- Gorman, get out of the way.
- This way.

01:58:27.183 --> 01:58:28.852
What?

01:58:29.853 --> 01:58:35.066
- Wait. Get behind me.
- Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

01:58:37.235 --> 01:58:39.195
Come on, let's go.

01:58:41.031 --> 01:58:42.365
Move.

01:58:49.205 --> 01:58:52.876
- Which way to the landing field?
- This way.

01:58:57.255 --> 01:58:59.382
Go right.

01:59:02.719 --> 01:59:04.512
This way.

01:59:13.772 --> 01:59:16.608
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

01:59:17.025 --> 01:59:20.236
Bishop, do you read me? Come in.

01:59:20.403 --> 01:59:22.238
The ship is on its way.

01:59:22.405 --> 01:59:25.367
ETA 16 minutes.

01:59:25.533 --> 01:59:28.244
Good. Stand by there. We're on our way.

01:59:39.631 --> 01:59:43.009
- Which way now?
- That way. No, wait. This way.

01:59:43.176 --> 01:59:44.636
You sure?

01:59:46.221 --> 01:59:47.764
Move!

01:59:51.768 --> 01:59:53.895
It's just up here.

01:59:54.896 --> 01:59:58.024
- We're almost there.
- Wait.

02:00:27.929 --> 02:00:29.973
Go.

02:00:46.656 --> 02:00:50.201
Up there. There's a shortcut
across the roof.

02:01:01.796 --> 02:01:05.216
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

02:01:26.905 --> 02:01:30.116
Hicks, get her. Hurry.

02:01:35.038 --> 02:01:36.998
- Hold on.
- I'm slipping.

02:01:37.165 --> 02:01:39.209
Don't let go.

02:01:39.375 --> 02:01:41.377
- Hold on.
- Help!

02:01:41.544 --> 02:01:43.254
Got ya.

02:01:43.421 --> 02:01:45.131
I got ya.

02:01:54.057 --> 02:01:57.060
We can find her with this.

02:01:57.393 --> 02:02:01.564
Stay where you are. We're coming.

02:02:19.374 --> 02:02:21.668
This way.

02:02:22.710 --> 02:02:24.587
She's close.

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:33.429
Where are you? Can you hear me?

02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:39.060
- I'm here.
- Where?

02:02:44.065 --> 02:02:46.109
Are you OK?

02:02:47.110 --> 02:02:49.946
- We need to cut it.
- Climb down, honey.

02:02:50.113 --> 02:02:52.490
We've gotta cut through.

02:03:02.292 --> 02:03:04.961
Don't move. Stay very still.

02:03:07.130 --> 02:03:09.841
We're almost there. Hang in there.

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:20.351
- I know.
- Hurry. I mean it.

02:03:34.991 --> 02:03:37.660
Newt, just stay still.

02:03:42.457 --> 02:03:45.126
Almost there.

02:04:02.852 --> 02:04:04.896
Let's go.

02:04:05.063 --> 02:04:08.399
They don't kill you, they...

02:04:08.566 --> 02:04:11.361
- She's alive!
- All right!

02:04:11.527 --> 02:04:15.657
I believe you. She's alive.
We've gotta go. Now!

02:04:48.731 --> 02:04:50.858
Get it off.

02:05:01.244 --> 02:05:03.079
Here.

02:05:07.417 --> 02:05:09.460
Go.

02:05:11.754 --> 02:05:14.257
You can make it.

02:05:38.072 --> 02:05:42.618
- Bishop, how much time?
- Plenty. 26 minutes.

02:05:42.785 --> 02:05:46.122
- We're not leaving.
- We're not?

02:07:11.332 --> 02:07:14.794
I don't wanna hear it.
She's alive. There's still time.

02:07:14.961 --> 02:07:17.380
In 19 minutes,
this area's gonna be a vapor cloud.

02:07:17.547 --> 02:07:19.966
- Don't let him leave.
- We ain't going anywhere.

02:07:23.886 --> 02:07:26.472
- See you, Hicks.
- Dwayne.

02:07:27.682 --> 02:07:29.350
It's Dwayne.

02:07:31.227 --> 02:07:33.020
Ellen.

02:07:33.855 --> 02:07:36.732
Don't be gone long, Ellen.

02:07:44.282 --> 02:07:51.414
Attention. Emergency.
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

02:07:51.581 --> 02:07:57.086
You have 15 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:08:43.341 --> 02:08:46.052
Attention. Emergency.

02:08:46.219 --> 02:08:50.431
All personnel must evacuate immediately.

02:08:50.598 --> 02:08:55.978
You have 14 minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:12:54.884 --> 02:12:58.220
Grab on to me. Hold on.

02:16:49.618 --> 02:16:51.286
Let's go.

02:16:54.748 --> 02:16:56.667
Behind us.

02:18:02.983 --> 02:18:07.988
You have four minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:18:23.754 --> 02:18:26.507
Come on, goddammit!

02:18:32.554 --> 02:18:35.265
Hold on to me.

02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:34.783
You have two minutes
to reach minimum safe distance.

02:19:47.462 --> 02:19:50.299
Bishop, goddamn you!

02:20:54.154 --> 02:20:56.198
Close your eyes, baby.

02:20:58.533 --> 02:21:00.786
Look!

02:21:07.793 --> 02:21:09.670
Come on.

02:21:38.448 --> 02:21:40.701
Punch it.

02:22:26.413 --> 02:22:28.457
We're OK.

02:22:41.136 --> 02:22:43.305
We made it.

02:22:43.472 --> 02:22:45.766
I knew you'd come.

02:23:00.655 --> 02:23:06.161
He'll be all right. He's just out.
I had to give him another shot for the pain.

02:23:06.328 --> 02:23:10.290
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to Medical.

02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:20.550
Sorry if I scared you.
That platform was becoming too unstable.

02:23:20.717 --> 02:23:25.305
I had to hope
things didn't get too rough to take you off.

02:23:26.515 --> 02:23:29.184
- You did OK.
- I did?

02:24:10.225 --> 02:24:12.185
Go. Move.

02:24:14.896 --> 02:24:17.774
No, here!

02:24:19.234 --> 02:24:20.610
Run.

02:24:25.115 --> 02:24:26.741
Here.

02:25:55.455 --> 02:25:57.749
Get away from her, you bitch!

02:26:20.855 --> 02:26:23.400
Come on!

02:29:54.736 --> 02:29:57.030
- Mommy.
- Oh, God...

02:30:00.575 --> 02:30:03.828
Not bad for a human.

02:30:51.084 --> 02:30:53.962
Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

02:30:54.295 --> 02:30:56.965
- All the way home.
- Can I dream?

02:30:59.133 --> 02:31:01.928
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

02:31:10.061 --> 02:31:12.814
- Sleep tight.
- Affirmative.
