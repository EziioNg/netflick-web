WEBVTT

03:11.708 --> 03:15.610
Hang on, hang on. Come on.

03:17.013 --> 03:19.948
Where are you, Charlie?
More importantly, where is my money?

03:20.049 --> 03:23.382
- You're into me for 30 grand.
- Jack, I'm going to pay you.

03:23.486 --> 03:25.852
This ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.482
You owe Jack money, too?
You pay me first!

03:29.592 --> 03:34.359
Bill. We're good, buddy. I got your
money. It's right here in my hand.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.364
Why don't we meet up on the?

03:40.937 --> 03:43.906
- Your phone's going all screwy. Hello?
- I'm losing you.

03:44.007 --> 03:46.498
I can't hear what you're say...

03:48.945 --> 03:51.743
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?

03:53.449 --> 03:55.644
- Yeah.
- Can we see him?

03:56.986 --> 03:59.386
- You want to see him?
- Yeah.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.753
Give me a minute.

04:07.930 --> 04:09.056
This...

04:10.867 --> 04:13.529
is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.822
- What robot is he fighting?
- Actually he's going to fight...

04:36.926 --> 04:38.484
Whoa, little lady. What are you doing?

04:38.594 --> 04:39.891
Can we get a picture with him?

04:39.996 --> 04:41.657
Sure. For five dollars.

04:41.764 --> 04:43.857
You want five dollars? Seriously?

04:43.966 --> 04:46.594
No, I want five dollars immediately.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.398
Come on, guys.

04:49.839 --> 04:53.172
- All right, I'm kidding. Three bucks.
- Whatever.

04:53.476 --> 04:56.104
- How about $2.50?
- You suck!

04:59.415 --> 05:01.747
It's going to be one
of those towns, huh?

05:02.719 --> 05:07.588
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

05:07.690 --> 05:11.148
Please take your seats. We're almost
ready to get this thing started.

05:13.463 --> 05:15.897
I was told my bot
was fighting an 800-pound steer.

05:15.998 --> 05:18.728
That is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.

05:18.835 --> 05:23.795
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time
has not been good to you, my friend.

05:23.906 --> 05:28.536
- Ricky, we got a big problem here.
- Slow down there, hoss.

05:28.644 --> 05:33.138
Last time I saw you, you were staring
at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center

05:33.449 --> 05:35.747
with the taste of my right cross
all over your face.

05:37.854 --> 05:39.685
- Are we good to go here?
- Yeah.

05:39.789 --> 05:43.657
We agreed that my boxer would fight
an 800-pound steer for three grand.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.489
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir. We did.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.620
That bull is like 2,000 pounds.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.220
I'll tell you something.

05:49.532 --> 05:53.730
Your bot don't fight,
you don't get paid! How about that?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.163
Get the hell out of here.

06:01.577 --> 06:04.842
Why don't we make this more interesting.
My bot against your bull, straight up.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.006
- How much?
- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.778
- Twenty grand. You got 20 grand?
- In a safe in my truck.

06:13.222 --> 06:14.746
All right, Charlie.

06:14.857 --> 06:18.987
Twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

06:19.095 --> 06:21.586
I'll come after you and beat you
to within an inch of your life.

06:21.697 --> 06:23.858
You know that I can do that
because I already done done it!

06:23.966 --> 06:27.800
In life you get too close, in the ring
you stand back like a girl. Just shake.

06:28.104 --> 06:33.007
All right. Shake and pow! Just like that
once again. You want to dance again?

06:33.109 --> 06:36.567
Cheer for this guy. Give him some luck.
He needs some luck, y'all.

06:37.079 --> 06:39.673
Don't touch that bull.

06:39.782 --> 06:42.876
Ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask,

06:42.985 --> 06:45.545
do we have any fans
of robot boxing here today?

06:48.157 --> 06:50.216
Now, listen, friends, I understand

06:50.526 --> 06:54.121
we can't all afford to go
all the way over there to Dallas

06:54.230 --> 06:59.167
and pay $300 for one of those
World Robot Boxing League fights.

06:59.268 --> 07:02.567
So, I decided that I would bring
a robot boxing match

07:02.672 --> 07:06.039
right here to our little fair
here in San Leandro.

07:06.142 --> 07:07.575
How about that?

07:10.813 --> 07:14.772
Ladies and gentlemen,
I introduce to you,

07:14.884 --> 07:17.546
Ambush!

07:17.653 --> 07:18.950
Let's do it!

07:21.657 --> 07:22.954
All right, big fella.

07:28.598 --> 07:30.259
He's a big fella, ain't he?

07:30.566 --> 07:34.002
Take a turn.
Let them see how beautiful you are.

07:38.808 --> 07:39.866
Show them some power.

07:41.010 --> 07:43.843
Look at that.
He's getting all kung fu-y on us.

07:45.014 --> 07:46.276
Yeah, big fella.

07:46.582 --> 07:49.642
Ambush's opponent today,
he's last year's runner-up

07:49.752 --> 07:51.811
in the baddest of the bulls competition,

07:51.921 --> 07:54.754
ladies and gentlemen,

07:54.857 --> 07:57.621
Black Thunder!

07:59.028 --> 08:01.758
- Let's get it on!
- Let's get this thing started.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.963
Is that all you got?

08:08.104 --> 08:10.937
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.

08:20.883 --> 08:22.282
Take him, take him.

08:23.819 --> 08:27.220
Ambush lays the smackdown
on that prime beef.

08:33.062 --> 08:35.155
I got more for you, big fella.
We're just getting started.

08:38.634 --> 08:40.124
OK. Jump, now!

08:48.177 --> 08:49.804
Ambush, decks Black Thunder,

08:49.912 --> 08:53.211
but when you mess with the bull,
you're going to get the horns.

08:56.052 --> 08:58.350
You like that. I can tell.
You like that.

09:00.256 --> 09:01.382
Turn around!

09:05.194 --> 09:07.822
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!

09:18.007 --> 09:20.874
Come on. We're still in this thing.
Just hop. Hop.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.304
That's it. Come on.

09:27.416 --> 09:29.976
Ricky, enough! Enough!

09:30.086 --> 09:33.249
I can't hear you over the sound
of your robot being destroyed.

09:34.757 --> 09:36.850
Kill! Kill! Kill!

09:38.227 --> 09:39.387
Come on, get up.

09:40.363 --> 09:41.830
Get up! Come on!

09:45.368 --> 09:46.392
No!

09:50.439 --> 09:53.237
Come on, no. No, no, no!

09:59.448 --> 10:03.043
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our warriors out here today

10:03.152 --> 10:05.848
at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.

10:05.955 --> 10:07.889
Thank you for coming out,

10:07.990 --> 10:11.721
and we'll see you next time,
because there will be one.

10:12.762 --> 10:13.786
Give me that leg.

10:13.896 --> 10:15.796
Sure. For five dollars.

10:15.898 --> 10:17.490
Boo-yah!

10:19.402 --> 10:24.169
All right! That was ridiculous fun,
now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

10:25.274 --> 10:28.766
I'm going to come by for my money,
Charlie boy. You best have it.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.937
- Everybody say "hey!"
- Hey!

10:31.047 --> 10:34.847
- Everybody say "ho!"
- Ho!

10:34.950 --> 10:38.147
How about that?
How you doing there, little robot?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.462
My keys, damn it.

10:57.339 --> 10:59.364
One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

10:59.475 --> 11:00.874
Charlie, relax.

11:00.976 --> 11:03.877
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus
fight. It cost me my last robot.

11:03.979 --> 11:06.846
- Just listen to us.
- Do you recall Caroline Fallon?

11:07.450 --> 11:10.419
She's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen
her in ten years. What does she want?

11:10.519 --> 11:12.248
Nothing. She died.

11:13.055 --> 11:14.488
Do you recall Max Kenton?

11:16.258 --> 11:18.123
He's my son. He's got to be nine.

11:18.227 --> 11:19.956
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

11:21.464 --> 11:22.954
Is he dead, too?

11:23.065 --> 11:25.898
No, he's fine. That's why we're here.

11:52.094 --> 11:55.894
This court is convened
to address the custodial status

11:55.998 --> 11:58.262
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

11:58.367 --> 12:02.997
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.
Father, Charles Kenton.

12:03.105 --> 12:05.130
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

12:05.241 --> 12:10.543
Yes. As I've already told you,
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

12:10.846 --> 12:14.213
and we can more than provide for Max.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.843
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

12:17.953 --> 12:19.887
next of kin retains custody.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.152
Charles Kenton,
who is aware of this custody hearing,

12:23.259 --> 12:24.556
and we are expecting him...

12:24.860 --> 12:27.294
I need a new robot now.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.887
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.296
I got to show up with something.

12:31.400 --> 12:36.303
Noisy Boy is for sale?
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.

12:36.405 --> 12:39.101
How much? That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

12:40.209 --> 12:41.471
I can live with that.

12:42.912 --> 12:44.277
I don't have it.

12:44.380 --> 12:48.441
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights
to custody right after the boy was born.

12:48.551 --> 12:51.179
I can more than provide for Max.

12:53.422 --> 12:54.616
Please be Charles Kenton.

12:57.426 --> 12:59.257
Charlie, yeah.

13:00.563 --> 13:02.997
I'm here to sign some paper
that releases my rights

13:03.098 --> 13:05.066
to the custody of my son.

13:05.167 --> 13:07.101
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.465
Charlie.

13:09.505 --> 13:10.995
Do you even remember me?

13:11.941 --> 13:14.307
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, Debra. How are you?

13:14.410 --> 13:16.344
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.942
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

13:23.052 --> 13:24.076
Yes, you may.

13:24.186 --> 13:25.983
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

13:26.088 --> 13:28.522
You can spend some time
with him, if you'd like.

13:28.624 --> 13:30.353
- With the kid?
- Yeah, the kid.

13:30.459 --> 13:32.359
- Max. Your son?
- All right.

13:32.461 --> 13:35.259
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.034
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

13:39.134 --> 13:41.534
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

13:46.942 --> 13:50.139
Your Honor, I'd like to,
at this juncture,

13:50.246 --> 13:52.942
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

13:53.048 --> 13:54.072
Please.

13:57.686 --> 14:02.055
Come on. Come on. There you are.

14:03.025 --> 14:05.687
He'll be in a foster home.

14:05.995 --> 14:10.091
No, they find good families.
Young. Energetic. Yeah.

14:11.233 --> 14:14.725
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

14:17.539 --> 14:21.100
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

14:21.210 --> 14:24.179
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

14:26.615 --> 14:29.550
- I'm up for it. But...
- Seventy-five grand.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.744
$75,000? You're serious?

14:36.458 --> 14:38.085
The thing is...

14:39.094 --> 14:41.289
we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

14:41.397 --> 14:43.160
with my oldest friend and his wife.

14:43.265 --> 14:45.324
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

14:45.434 --> 14:46.765
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

14:47.069 --> 14:49.299
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.267
In August. A hundred.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.309
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

14:55.411 --> 14:57.641
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

14:57.746 --> 15:01.238
if you tell her I just signed over
that kid to the state of Texas.

15:01.350 --> 15:05.013
There's a real way everyone gets
what they want here.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.247
So here's what you're going to do.

15:07.356 --> 15:10.416
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

15:10.526 --> 15:12.653
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

15:12.761 --> 15:15.321
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

15:15.431 --> 15:17.626
for being such
a terrible absentee dad,

15:17.733 --> 15:22.033
how I want to make good with junior,
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

15:22.137 --> 15:26.073
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero
and everybody wins.

15:29.044 --> 15:32.707
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

15:33.716 --> 15:35.343
I understand.

15:35.451 --> 15:37.646
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

15:37.753 --> 15:40.221
and the other 50
when we get back in August

15:40.322 --> 15:42.222
and you deliver him to us in New York.

15:42.725 --> 15:44.488
Pleasure doing business with you.

15:47.329 --> 15:49.593
Your Honor,
I'm happy we all took the time

15:49.698 --> 15:51.325
to make the best decision for everyone.

15:54.737 --> 15:56.364
- Happy?
- Yeah, it's me.

15:56.472 --> 15:59.703
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.

15:59.808 --> 16:02.470
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

16:17.693 --> 16:18.717
Hello?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.324
Bailey?

16:21.430 --> 16:23.159
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

16:23.265 --> 16:25.529
and it smells like disaster to me.

16:25.634 --> 16:27.124
Nice to see you, too.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.137
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.675
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower? Come on.

16:33.776 --> 16:35.607
Let me make something clear.

16:35.711 --> 16:38.612
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

16:38.714 --> 16:41.148
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.150
Putting aside the fact
that you're doing

16:43.252 --> 16:45.880
what I'm guessing is
a black market deal on my doorstep,

16:46.188 --> 16:48.156
how will you pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.157
The money is on its way.
Just distract him.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.590
I have been. It's exhausting.

16:51.693 --> 16:53.627
- You're the best.
- Yeah? Really?

16:53.729 --> 16:56.755
Is that why you're buying a $45,000
robot when you owe me six grand in rent?

16:56.865 --> 16:58.355
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

16:58.467 --> 17:03.700
Six. There is a guy with real money
who wants to buy this place.

17:03.806 --> 17:06.172
Come on. Like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.335
If you don't make rent, I can't make
payments and I won't have a choice.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.379
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass

17:11.480 --> 17:13.311
- if you sold this place.
- My father would climb out of his grave

17:13.415 --> 17:14.712
and kick your ass.

17:17.419 --> 17:18.443
Bailey?

17:24.526 --> 17:25.550
- Don't.
- Don't what?

17:25.661 --> 17:27.219
Don't do that.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.323
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

17:33.902 --> 17:35.699
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.897
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

17:38.207 --> 17:42.166
I used to. Once. Briefly.
Now I like money more.

17:42.845 --> 17:45.871
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

17:48.417 --> 17:49.441
Marvin.

17:50.452 --> 17:52.511
Your money has arrived.

17:54.823 --> 17:55.847
Marv.

18:00.462 --> 18:02.555
Fifty grand, as promised.

18:03.432 --> 18:08.631
Here are all our numbers
and contact info over in Europe.

18:08.737 --> 18:10.466
So that's everything there.

18:13.408 --> 18:16.241
So Marvin tells me
you want this time with Max.

18:16.745 --> 18:18.542
- Yeah.
- You did the right thing,

18:18.647 --> 18:19.773
giving me custody.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.372
Caroline would have wanted that.

18:22.651 --> 18:25.313
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

18:26.588 --> 18:27.782
That's a deal.

18:28.490 --> 18:32.483
OK, let's go get Max.
OK? Let's get Max.

18:35.764 --> 18:39.461
It's OK. You want to go around
the other side here and I'll get Max?

18:40.903 --> 18:44.395
Hey. Max. See you, pal.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.908
Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

18:57.819 --> 18:59.309
I'm Charlie.

19:03.692 --> 19:05.819
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

19:05.928 --> 19:07.987
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

19:08.297 --> 19:09.355
Do you know where they're going?

19:09.464 --> 19:11.398
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.797
So how did I get stuck here with you?

19:12.901 --> 19:15.802
Relax, kid. You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

19:15.904 --> 19:16.928
Charlie!

19:17.806 --> 19:19.637
Dude's pissed. He's going to take off.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.844
- Did Marvin give you that money?
- Here, just close the deal.

19:23.946 --> 19:25.573
I'll be right there, OK?

19:30.719 --> 19:32.687
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

19:34.489 --> 19:35.751
Max Kenton.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.018
- So this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

19:39.328 --> 19:40.625
Don't worry about it, OK?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.326
I'm looking at you two and...

19:43.432 --> 19:45.696
Just go and put Noisy
in the shop, please? Thank you.

19:52.674 --> 19:54.608
You're going to stay here with her
while I'm on the road.

19:54.710 --> 19:57.577
- How much did he give you?
- You're coming at this the wrong way.

19:57.679 --> 19:59.442
No, tell me. I want to know.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.747
Fifty thousand, OK?

20:02.851 --> 20:05.342
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.853
Will you shut up now?

20:07.556 --> 20:08.682
You sold me?

20:09.992 --> 20:11.482
Sounds worse than it is.

20:11.593 --> 20:14.357
- Really.
- It's to take care of you.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.794
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

20:15.897 --> 20:18.661
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

20:18.767 --> 20:21.031
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

20:21.336 --> 20:22.769
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

20:23.538 --> 20:26.029
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

20:26.341 --> 20:30.607
I don't have it! I spent the money
on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!

20:30.712 --> 20:32.009
I'm through here.

20:40.756 --> 20:42.724
What do we got?

20:42.824 --> 20:44.587
Noisy Boy has arrived.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.056
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.528
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

20:54.636 --> 20:56.763
Maybe that's why you got
such a good price, genius.

20:59.941 --> 21:01.431
Decided to stay?

21:02.077 --> 21:05.069
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.940
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.848
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

21:12.721 --> 21:14.621
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

21:14.723 --> 21:16.418
Noisy Boy's in there.
You ever heard of him?

21:16.525 --> 21:20.017
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

21:26.401 --> 21:28.426
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

21:30.405 --> 21:34.102
His composite armor has been replaced.
Let's see if the insides look as good.

21:34.409 --> 21:37.936
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.843
He should have had him
in the third round,

21:39.948 --> 21:42.712
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.723
Relax, kid, he's on our side.

21:58.834 --> 22:00.825
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

22:00.936 --> 22:02.528
You know he has voice recognition,
right?

22:02.637 --> 22:04.434
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

22:04.539 --> 22:06.473
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.066
Brazilians are crazy
about that talk-to-your-robot crap.

22:11.980 --> 22:13.743
Right, left, uppercut!

22:17.152 --> 22:20.883
Doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!

22:20.989 --> 22:23.184
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

22:23.492 --> 22:25.926
- Let me see if I can fix it.
- Look how good he looks, too.

22:26.027 --> 22:28.018
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

22:28.130 --> 22:30.496
- Why didn't you ask to look at it?
- Relax!

22:35.670 --> 22:37.501
Was that Japanese?

22:42.577 --> 22:44.101
Let me see if I can reset him
to English.

22:44.212 --> 22:45.804
How do you know Japanese?

22:45.914 --> 22:47.506
Video games.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.111
You play video games in Japanese?

22:50.218 --> 22:51.947
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

22:57.826 --> 22:59.157
Give me that.

23:00.228 --> 23:02.662
He's reset to English,
and I found his command matrix.

23:02.764 --> 23:04.994
They have pre-loaded
a bunch of combinations.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.591
They should be listed here.

23:09.905 --> 23:10.929
Top salvo!

23:14.042 --> 23:15.168
What did I tell you?

23:16.545 --> 23:18.069
Gravity One Downtown!

23:22.717 --> 23:24.548
I was due for some good luck!

23:24.653 --> 23:26.120
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

23:26.221 --> 23:29.156
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

23:42.938 --> 23:45.031
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.869
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

23:46.975 --> 23:48.840
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

23:48.944 --> 23:52.812
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

23:52.914 --> 23:55.747
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

23:56.818 --> 23:59.582
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

24:01.122 --> 24:03.989
- Don't do that again.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

24:04.092 --> 24:05.787
Don't do this again?

24:06.294 --> 24:08.762
Get in. Just get in.
Give me the keys first.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.560
Wait till I get in the truck.
Thanks, Big Pops.

24:18.139 --> 24:19.299
Sweet ride.

24:19.608 --> 24:22.168
Put on your seatbelt and don't talk.

24:43.265 --> 24:45.825
I'm taking all bets!

25:11.192 --> 25:13.057
Keep up. Stay close.

25:16.698 --> 25:19.166
Charlie Kenton is in the house!

25:19.267 --> 25:21.792
- All right, all right.
- Come on, man!

25:23.138 --> 25:25.902
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

25:26.007 --> 25:27.998
That's Noisy Boy!

25:32.280 --> 25:34.908
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

25:35.016 --> 25:37.211
- Sure you want to fight him tonight?
- What do you got?

25:37.319 --> 25:39.685
He can take any bot in this place.
You know it.

25:41.056 --> 25:42.819
You can have any undercard you want.

25:42.924 --> 25:44.221
Five thousand guaranteed.

25:44.326 --> 25:47.261
A thousand every round
your bot survives.

25:47.362 --> 25:49.262
Fight till the death!

25:52.067 --> 25:54.365
No. Give me the main event.

25:54.669 --> 25:56.830
- Come on.
- This is Noisy Boy.

25:56.938 --> 25:58.371
An original Tak Mashido bot.

25:58.673 --> 26:01.233
He was a World Robot League boxer.
Come on!

26:04.045 --> 26:05.945
You want to fight Midas?

26:06.047 --> 26:09.175
Fifty thousand guaranteed,
winner takes all.

26:10.685 --> 26:13.745
Fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.

26:13.855 --> 26:15.755
Listen, listen. No, look.

26:15.857 --> 26:17.381
- Listen!
- Give me a sec.

26:17.692 --> 26:20.889
We should take an undercard fight,
make a little cash and get out of here!

26:20.996 --> 26:22.258
First, there is no "we."

26:22.364 --> 26:25.731
Second, he's going to crush Midas,
and I'm going to make real cash!

26:26.701 --> 26:28.396
We'll take Midas!

26:40.849 --> 26:43.750
Tonight, our main event

26:43.852 --> 26:48.846
features the gold-blooded killer!

26:50.191 --> 26:52.785
This pimped-out punk

26:52.894 --> 26:56.489
is programmed for pain!

26:57.298 --> 27:02.326
I give to you the mighty Midas!

27:43.244 --> 27:46.145
Against a bot

27:46.247 --> 27:51.082
who ran with the big boys in the WRB!

27:51.953 --> 27:57.084
He's been on an exile tour overseas,
but now he's back home,

27:57.192 --> 27:59.490
and he's ready to make some noise!

27:59.794 --> 28:03.355
Take your first look in a long time

28:03.465 --> 28:08.232
at Noisy Boy!

28:45.840 --> 28:48.001
Crash Palace,

28:48.109 --> 28:53.012
who's ready for some destruction?!

28:54.115 --> 28:57.607
Let's make some money! Come on!

28:57.919 --> 29:00.615
We have Midas against Noisy Boy.

29:00.922 --> 29:02.890
Noisy Boy against Midas.

29:02.991 --> 29:06.222
You've been waiting all night
for this match up, Crash Palace!

29:12.467 --> 29:13.866
Scimitar right!

29:16.971 --> 29:18.495
Did you see that?

29:18.606 --> 29:21.905
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

29:22.010 --> 29:25.173
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

29:25.914 --> 29:27.313
Skull salvo! Firefight!

29:30.084 --> 29:33.076
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

29:35.623 --> 29:36.920
Shockfist!

29:40.161 --> 29:41.958
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

29:43.431 --> 29:45.661
Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

29:49.170 --> 29:50.660
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

29:53.208 --> 29:55.403
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

29:59.047 --> 30:00.605
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

30:02.217 --> 30:03.241
I got something for you.

30:04.485 --> 30:07.477
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

30:09.524 --> 30:10.650
Get up!

30:13.928 --> 30:15.054
That's illegal!

30:15.163 --> 30:17.256
This is the underworld.
There are no rules!

30:18.199 --> 30:19.632
Now we're seeing the Midas touch.

30:19.934 --> 30:21.128
No. Hands up!

30:21.236 --> 30:24.296
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

30:28.209 --> 30:29.972
He's getting killed in there!

30:32.347 --> 30:36.613
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

30:36.918 --> 30:38.180
Panic Shield!

30:39.087 --> 30:41.180
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

30:45.293 --> 30:47.989
No, no. Shatter Punch!

30:52.166 --> 30:53.997
- Five Recall!
- Get some!

31:00.208 --> 31:01.175
Jab, jab!

31:08.516 --> 31:09.608
Right roundhouse!

31:09.717 --> 31:13.209
Did he just spit his juice
in Midas's face?

31:13.321 --> 31:15.983
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

31:16.090 --> 31:18.422
It's party time now, Crash Palace!

31:18.526 --> 31:19.618
Use your left!

31:20.128 --> 31:22.426
Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

31:22.530 --> 31:25.693
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

31:31.272 --> 31:33.467
No, no! Get up!

31:35.209 --> 31:36.267
Get some!

31:38.146 --> 31:40.080
Move! Get out of the corner!

31:40.181 --> 31:43.548
Midas! Midas! Midas!

31:45.286 --> 31:48.778
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

31:49.090 --> 31:51.115
I got something for you! You ready?

31:53.027 --> 31:56.463
Good night! That's a home run for Midas.

31:56.564 --> 31:59.397
And so long to Noisy Boy.

32:31.466 --> 32:33.263
That sucked. You hungry?

32:34.736 --> 32:37.136
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

32:37.238 --> 32:40.105
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.836
I need to find a mainframe. What?

32:43.144 --> 32:45.374
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

32:45.480 --> 32:48.779
Fine. More for me. Here, drink this.

32:49.083 --> 32:50.641
You never should have taken that fight.

32:50.752 --> 32:53.118
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.520
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

32:56.624 --> 32:58.819
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

32:59.127 --> 33:02.426
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

33:02.530 --> 33:05.260
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

33:05.366 --> 33:07.800
- You never gave him a chance.
- He wasn't that good.

33:08.102 --> 33:09.535
Noisy Boy was a great robot.

33:09.637 --> 33:12.435
Was. Was a great robot
back in the League, back in the day.

33:12.540 --> 33:16.533
But look around you. This place is
where once great robots go to die.

33:16.644 --> 33:18.202
So throw him away.

33:18.312 --> 33:21.406
That's what you do, right?
Anything you don't need you throw away.

33:23.518 --> 33:24.610
Wow.

33:27.121 --> 33:28.418
It's been a long night.

33:28.523 --> 33:30.718
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.690
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

34:02.457 --> 34:04.152
They gave me 400 for his head.

34:21.843 --> 34:24.334
You stay put.
I'm going to look for parts.

34:24.445 --> 34:27.471
I'm coming with you.
That drink has my heart pounding.

34:27.582 --> 34:29.709
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

34:29.817 --> 34:31.409
Whatever. Just keep up.

34:42.630 --> 34:44.427
Crap.

34:44.532 --> 34:45.829
Stay back.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.339
All right, keep up.

35:00.882 --> 35:03.476
These searchlights are automated,
but you got to time them right,

35:03.584 --> 35:04.642
so stay close.

35:08.422 --> 35:09.514
It's all right.

35:10.625 --> 35:11.922
Come on, come on.

35:13.461 --> 35:15.429
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.264
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.564
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

35:25.573 --> 35:28.406
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

35:30.678 --> 35:33.670
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!

35:50.665 --> 35:52.530
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

35:52.633 --> 35:55.261
Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

35:55.369 --> 35:57.394
- Hey, look.
- What?

35:59.540 --> 36:01.531
It's so small.

36:01.642 --> 36:03.371
Yeah. That's before your time.

36:03.477 --> 36:06.571
That's a Generation One,
the very first fighting bot.

36:06.681 --> 36:09.878
They wanted them to look like us.
The more human, the better.

36:09.984 --> 36:12.782
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Put that in the cart.

36:12.887 --> 36:16.015
- What changed?
- A good question. Human boxing.

36:16.324 --> 36:18.292
- It just faded.
- Why?

36:18.960 --> 36:23.624
Because the money moved on.
People wanted more carnage, more show.

36:23.731 --> 36:26.825
You had the whole Brazilian underground,
the Gracies, the Machados,

36:26.934 --> 36:30.301
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,
and a thousand styles in between.

36:30.404 --> 36:31.735
Full-on ground-and-pound.

36:31.839 --> 36:33.067
- Look at this.
- What's that?

36:33.374 --> 36:34.534
I don't know.

36:34.642 --> 36:35.904
Not bad. Good spot.

36:36.811 --> 36:39.041
You still had human fighters,
human bodies,

36:39.347 --> 36:41.577
so you couldn't give the people
what they really wanted:

36:41.682 --> 36:43.946
True, no-holds-barred violence.

36:46.654 --> 36:48.781
The next logical step,

36:48.889 --> 36:52.017
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

36:53.027 --> 36:54.517
Do you miss it?

36:56.964 --> 36:59.524
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

36:59.634 --> 37:01.067
What? I want to know.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.929
Careful, you're on a cliff.

37:07.708 --> 37:10.643
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

37:19.887 --> 37:22.412
Charlie, help me!

37:46.547 --> 37:48.014
Charlie!

37:49.350 --> 37:52.080
- Charlie!
- Max! Max!

37:54.021 --> 37:55.045
Max!

37:57.992 --> 38:01.587
- Try not to move!
- I'm on some sort of robot arm.

38:01.696 --> 38:05.723
Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

38:05.833 --> 38:10.167
Very slowly. Good. Don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.

38:10.471 --> 38:14.168
That's it! I've got you!
You don't have to be scared. I got you!

38:14.475 --> 38:16.773
- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.175
Give me your other hand. Nice and slow.

38:19.880 --> 38:24.840
Just give me your other hand very
slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!

38:24.952 --> 38:27.580
Look at me.
We're going to do this together.

38:27.688 --> 38:30.885
You and me. Just look at me. That's it.

38:31.959 --> 38:35.451
One... two... three!

38:37.498 --> 38:42.765
That's it. I got you!
I got you. I got you. I got you.

38:49.477 --> 38:51.672
You're safe. You're safe.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.880
All right, I got you.

38:56.984 --> 38:58.542
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:58.652 --> 39:01.052
Come here. Easy. Easy.

39:02.823 --> 39:04.188
You all right?

39:04.492 --> 39:05.823
- You all right?
- Yeah.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.860
I told you it was dangerous.

39:08.662 --> 39:10.186
Careful. We're still on the edge here.

39:23.110 --> 39:26.204
Charlie, I think
there's a whole robot in there.

39:26.514 --> 39:27.776
So what? Let's go. Come on.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.516
I'm taking him with me.
He saved my life.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.951
He did not save your life.
I saved your life. Let's go.

39:34.054 --> 39:37.046
Just bring the cart to the edge.
I'll use the winch to get him out.

39:37.158 --> 39:40.685
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.291
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

41:27.601 --> 41:28.625
That's it.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.296
His head does make a nice addition
to the front of the Crash Palace.

41:33.007 --> 41:35.669
- It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

41:35.776 --> 41:38.904
Good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

41:39.013 --> 41:41.880
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

41:41.982 --> 41:43.210
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

41:43.317 --> 41:45.649
- There's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.722
All your junk is... it's junk.

41:50.324 --> 41:52.918
You're not even in the game any more.

41:53.027 --> 41:54.961
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

41:55.062 --> 41:56.825
Don't get loud with me.

41:56.931 --> 41:58.831
- You're your problem.
- What's that supposed to mean?

41:58.933 --> 42:01.834
I have been here for you a long time.

42:01.936 --> 42:05.702
In the ring, out of the ring, and the
whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.

42:05.806 --> 42:09.867
My father invested everything he had
in your fight career. We loved...

42:11.378 --> 42:16.213
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

42:16.917 --> 42:19.681
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.252
What's yours?

42:34.101 --> 42:35.796
You're done, right?

42:35.903 --> 42:40.738
You're finally done?
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

42:41.842 --> 42:43.275
I got nothing left.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.336
All right.

42:48.916 --> 42:50.679
Maybe there's something here.

42:51.919 --> 42:55.821
This robot the kid brought in last
night. Would you look at it for me?

42:56.357 --> 42:57.381
Please?

43:06.266 --> 43:10.999
I've never seen anything like it before.
He's Generation Two, but barely.

43:11.105 --> 43:15.769
I found a power cell that fits him, and
I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.

43:15.876 --> 43:18.003
You can move him around, but he's crap.

43:18.112 --> 43:21.047
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

43:21.148 --> 43:22.342
Stop.

43:22.449 --> 43:24.144
It's my robot!

43:24.251 --> 43:27.948
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there. He's mine.

43:28.055 --> 43:31.718
He's yours? Yeah. But the parts
we're putting in him are mine!

43:32.993 --> 43:36.292
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you fight over him.

43:36.397 --> 43:37.864
What happened to you?

43:56.750 --> 43:58.217
Watch out. Stay back.

44:16.437 --> 44:19.804
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

44:20.507 --> 44:22.975
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.944
- Is there anything here we could use?
- Not much.

44:26.046 --> 44:27.104
There's a bucket...

44:28.382 --> 44:30.475
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck.

44:30.784 --> 44:33.480
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

44:33.787 --> 44:36.483
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

44:36.790 --> 44:39.953
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

44:40.060 --> 44:42.358
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.964
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

44:46.066 --> 44:48.899
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

44:49.436 --> 44:50.460
Cool.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.269
"Atom."

45:33.580 --> 45:37.016
His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

45:37.117 --> 45:38.414
I don't think he was
ever a boxing robot.

45:38.519 --> 45:42.546
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

45:42.856 --> 45:44.118
They must have built robots
like this one

45:44.224 --> 45:46.283
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

45:46.393 --> 45:48.554
OK, so can we get him a fight?

45:48.862 --> 45:51.353
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

45:51.465 --> 45:54.161
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

45:54.268 --> 45:55.929
You could always sell him off for parts.

45:56.036 --> 45:59.403
- Can't you get him a fight?
- "Why can't you get him a fight?"

45:59.506 --> 46:01.303
God, you don't quit, do you?

46:01.408 --> 46:04.343
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

46:04.444 --> 46:07.379
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

46:07.481 --> 46:11.645
The places that would let you fight this
robot would make you pee your pants.

46:11.952 --> 46:14.216
Excellent. Get him a fight.

46:20.327 --> 46:21.351
Stubborn kid.

46:21.461 --> 46:23.361
Surprise, surprise.

47:04.605 --> 47:06.095
Let's take a walk.

48:15.676 --> 48:17.200
Can you understand me?

48:25.152 --> 48:28.315
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

48:53.447 --> 48:55.176
You've known Charlie a long time.

48:56.216 --> 48:59.515
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

49:01.455 --> 49:02.752
My dad, he trained him.

49:04.224 --> 49:06.624
That's them. That's Charlie.

49:09.196 --> 49:11.187
- What was he like?
- As a boxer?

49:11.298 --> 49:13.493
- As anything.
- He was something.

49:13.600 --> 49:17.331
He was lean, tough.

49:17.437 --> 49:19.337
No quit, no fear.

49:23.744 --> 49:25.769
Come here. I want to show you something.

49:27.481 --> 49:31.645
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

49:31.752 --> 49:35.518
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

49:35.622 --> 49:37.146
You were at the Nico Tandy fight?

49:37.257 --> 49:41.250
I was. Charlie was supposed to be
a warm-up fight, an easy win.

49:41.361 --> 49:44.660
Nico wasn't even supposed
to break a sweat, but...

49:45.432 --> 49:50.301
nobody told Charlie that, so he
just kept coming and coming at him.

49:50.404 --> 49:51.701
Check this out.

49:54.775 --> 49:55.867
That's Charlie.

49:57.778 --> 50:00.474
First, Nico couldn't believe
the balls on this nobody.

50:00.580 --> 50:05.279
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

50:05.385 --> 50:07.216
- Really?
- Really.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.878
He was toying with Nico.

50:09.189 --> 50:11.680
The top contender,
number two in the world,

50:11.792 --> 50:13.851
and Charlie was dancing with him.

50:15.629 --> 50:18.689
Charlie was floating
inches off the canvas that night.

50:18.799 --> 50:21.700
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

50:23.136 --> 50:24.501
I could.

50:27.207 --> 50:28.504
He was beautiful.

50:29.576 --> 50:30.873
He was beautiful.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.581
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

50:36.683 --> 50:40.449
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

50:40.554 --> 50:42.419
Second time for good. Lights out.

50:42.522 --> 50:43.819
You were ahead on the scorecards

50:44.124 --> 50:46.251
- going into the 12th round.
- Nico Tandy rung my bell

50:46.359 --> 50:49.260
and went on to be the undefeated
world champ for the next three years.

50:49.362 --> 50:51.387
- He knocked you out?
- Yeah. So did a lot of guys.

50:51.498 --> 50:52.795
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

50:52.899 --> 50:57.359
- 24 and 19. It's not exactly a career.
- But every fight a knockout.

50:57.471 --> 50:58.870
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

50:59.172 --> 51:00.639
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

51:00.740 --> 51:03.265
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

51:03.376 --> 51:05.503
- Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

51:05.612 --> 51:07.546
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

51:07.647 --> 51:11.208
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.

51:11.318 --> 51:12.876
Wow. Here.

51:15.255 --> 51:16.347
Keep it.

51:17.557 --> 51:20.185
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

51:24.698 --> 51:26.495
I like that kid.

51:27.400 --> 51:28.697
He likes you.

51:33.707 --> 51:37.234
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

51:38.912 --> 51:40.470
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight

51:40.580 --> 51:43.777
to see if I can get a partner
or raise money to get a new bot.

51:44.885 --> 51:48.821
That's what you wanted, right? Me gone?

51:52.959 --> 51:55.427
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

52:03.803 --> 52:04.827
OK.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.000
Look.

52:49.282 --> 52:51.910
The champ is here. Zeus is here.

52:52.018 --> 52:53.645
Yeah.

52:55.689 --> 53:01.127
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds
with this monster. Two rounds!

53:01.361 --> 53:04.489
The champ puts his Real Steel world
championship belt on the line tonight.

53:04.598 --> 53:06.589
He just may have a real fight
on his hands.

53:06.700 --> 53:12.002
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time.
Ever. End of story. Good night!

53:12.839 --> 53:15.467
- So cool. It's so cool.
- What?

53:18.578 --> 53:19.602
Come on.

53:22.515 --> 53:24.574
Listen up. I got to go find Finn.

53:24.684 --> 53:26.481
I want you to stay in this area.

53:27.721 --> 53:30.622
Out of the way. Champ coming through.
Zeus coming through.

53:30.724 --> 53:32.351
Move, move. Champ coming through.

53:44.537 --> 53:47.665
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind
the father/daughter Zeus team.

53:47.774 --> 53:51.437
They say your father's the money
and you are the mind behind Zeus.

53:51.945 --> 53:53.435
You're very kind,

53:53.546 --> 53:57.482
but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

53:58.752 --> 54:02.085
What did it take to lure
the reclusive genius, former boy wonder

54:02.389 --> 54:05.552
and arguably the most important
bot designer in the history of the sport

54:05.659 --> 54:07.092
out of retirement?

54:07.994 --> 54:10.519
Why don't you ask him yourself?

54:15.402 --> 54:17.927
Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

54:19.572 --> 54:23.633
Zeus is autonomous
and constantly evolving during a fight.

54:23.743 --> 54:25.768
With his adaptive operating system,

54:25.879 --> 54:30.839
he recognizes patterns and rewrites
his fight code instantaneously.

54:32.419 --> 54:35.547
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus?

54:35.655 --> 54:39.921
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring...

54:40.794 --> 54:44.127
the result of any fight is inevitable.

54:45.432 --> 54:46.922
What Zeus sees...

54:48.501 --> 54:49.798
he kills.

54:51.404 --> 54:52.962
Sweet.

55:22.102 --> 55:23.535
I'm never going into business with you.

55:23.636 --> 55:24.864
I just need a break here.

55:24.971 --> 55:27.735
You got that old bot truck out there.
You always got something in there.

55:27.841 --> 55:30.435
I got an old sparring bot,
ain't worth the paint left on it.

55:30.543 --> 55:32.010
What am I supposed to do with that?

55:32.112 --> 55:34.876
The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

55:34.981 --> 55:37.006
Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

55:37.117 --> 55:39.017
I just need a little loan.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.680
What?

55:42.655 --> 55:44.555
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

55:44.657 --> 55:46.818
Couple hundred. Few hundred.
Whatever you got.

55:47.861 --> 55:49.453
You know I'm good for it.

55:49.562 --> 55:53.191
I know you, and as much
as I like you, dude...

55:54.434 --> 55:56.061
you're a bad bet, brother.

55:59.973 --> 56:01.065
Right, yeah.

56:21.161 --> 56:23.652
Did you see that?
That's what's left of Axelrod.

56:23.763 --> 56:25.628
Where you been? I told you to stay put.

56:25.732 --> 56:27.962
You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

56:28.067 --> 56:30.058
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

56:30.170 --> 56:34.504
He was just peppering Axelrod with
punches, but so fast. It was incredible.

56:34.607 --> 56:38.065
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.
He didn't even survive the first round.

56:38.178 --> 56:39.270
Is that what you think boxing is?

56:39.579 --> 56:41.604
Zeus beating up some piece of steel
that they feed him?

56:41.714 --> 56:44.615
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

56:44.717 --> 56:47.185
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

56:47.487 --> 56:50.513
You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

56:50.623 --> 56:53.956
He's more than that.
If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.

56:54.060 --> 56:57.086
You're in luck, kid.
There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

56:57.197 --> 56:58.960
Tomorrow afternoon,
you'll get your fight.

56:59.065 --> 57:01.533
- Great.
- And it will be the end.

57:02.602 --> 57:04.866
I told you I hate hamburgers!

57:08.708 --> 57:09.868
It's a burrito!

57:18.918 --> 57:20.545
Right uppercut.

57:23.089 --> 57:24.920
Left uppercut.

57:27.660 --> 57:31.562
Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

57:33.266 --> 57:37.794
Again. Bend your knees.
Rise up with both hands.

57:37.904 --> 57:40.134
You been up all night?

57:40.240 --> 57:41.764
Yeah. I cleaned him up.

57:41.875 --> 57:45.174
I'm using shadow mode to program some
fight moves and sync them to the remote.

57:45.278 --> 57:48.714
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch
you were showing him.

57:48.815 --> 57:51.010
That's lethal stuff.

57:51.117 --> 57:52.277
Let's do this.

57:54.020 --> 57:55.578
Let's do breakfast first.

58:32.859 --> 58:34.793
You know you're bringing him
home in pieces, right?

58:36.963 --> 58:38.089
We'll see.

58:46.272 --> 58:49.207
- Let me deal with this.
- Charlie Kenton. This is Max.

58:49.309 --> 58:51.140
Kingpin. Call me Kingpin.

58:51.244 --> 58:53.838
- All right, Kingpin, so...
- How much a round?

58:53.947 --> 58:55.642
We on a field trip?

58:57.817 --> 59:00.217
All right. He can fight my robot Metro.

59:00.320 --> 59:02.117
I'll give you a hundred bucks
for one two-minute round.

59:02.221 --> 59:03.654
- Take it.
- Three hundred.

59:03.756 --> 59:07.248
One hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to
give you $100 just to get in with Metro.

59:08.194 --> 59:10.025
How about 500 for two rounds?

59:10.930 --> 59:14.696
Two rounds. Son, he ain't
going to survive one round.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.235
- What if he does?
- He ain't.

59:17.937 --> 59:19.962
Let's just say he does.

59:21.908 --> 59:25.139
If he's still standing after one round...

59:26.179 --> 59:27.840
I'll give you a thousand bucks.

59:27.947 --> 59:29.039
Shut it!

59:33.086 --> 59:36.385
But if he dies in there,
which he will, junior...

59:38.291 --> 59:40.759
I get to keep what's left.

59:42.328 --> 59:43.761
Take the hundred.

59:44.263 --> 59:45.321
Deal.

59:46.232 --> 59:48.996
We're on. We on!

59:51.771 --> 59:53.295
Let's go!

59:53.406 --> 59:55.772
- You should have taken the hundred.
- I got us a thousand.

59:55.875 --> 59:57.172
Yeah, if he wins.

01:00:23.002 --> 01:00:24.435
You want me to drive?

01:00:24.737 --> 01:00:26.170
He's my bot. I got this!

01:00:26.272 --> 01:00:29.469
This ain't a video game.
This is for real. Right here.

01:00:29.776 --> 01:00:32.939
You said he's coming home in pieces.
What difference does it make?

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.206
All right.

01:00:36.182 --> 01:00:37.274
I got this.

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:39.783
Let's get it on! Let's get it on!

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:43.447
Let's get it on like
Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!

01:00:43.756 --> 01:00:46.316
Give me a bell! Give me a bell!

01:00:58.371 --> 01:01:00.896
Don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent.

01:01:01.007 --> 01:01:03.237
Watch out for that foot.
He's looking to pin you.

01:01:05.044 --> 01:01:07.205
I told you to watch for that foot plant.
Come on.

01:01:09.048 --> 01:01:10.777
Here comes the sledgehammer.

01:01:15.822 --> 01:01:16.982
Did you see that?

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.355
- Come on! Get him!
- Don't yell at him, control him.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.360
Slip right. Back step.

01:01:23.129 --> 01:01:24.255
Duck.

01:01:24.397 --> 01:01:26.831
- You're welcome.
- Shut up! You're not helping!

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:27.957
Actually, I think I am.

01:01:29.368 --> 01:01:34.203
Backhand. You got speed on this guy.
Just keep moving. Bob.

01:01:40.012 --> 01:01:42.845
Slip out of that corner.
Keep moving! Bob and weave!

01:01:43.816 --> 01:01:46.979
That's it! Now you're listening to me.

01:01:57.029 --> 01:02:00.226
He can take a hit. I'll give you this.
Your bot can take a hit.

01:02:02.835 --> 01:02:05.133
You better slip that headlock.
This ain't gonna end well for you.

01:02:05.238 --> 01:02:06.262
I'm trying!

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:15.206
Thirty seconds!

01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:18.346
Thirty... Half a minute.

01:02:19.418 --> 01:02:22.080
Half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!

01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:26.987
You've got 20 seconds!

01:02:28.294 --> 01:02:31.024
That's a thousand bucks.
Twenty seconds. Let me take over!

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:32.889
Move, then. Move!

01:02:39.972 --> 01:02:41.303
Come on.

01:02:41.407 --> 01:02:43.341
Get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.

01:02:45.545 --> 01:02:48.013
Count with me! Count with me! One!

01:02:48.114 --> 01:02:51.311
- Get up!
- You know you're talking to a machine?

01:02:51.417 --> 01:02:53.942
Four! Five! Six!

01:02:54.053 --> 01:02:55.452
Get up, Atom!

01:02:55.555 --> 01:02:58.080
All the way up! All the way up!

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:02.526
Yes! Yes!

01:03:07.066 --> 01:03:08.931
I'm going to fix it!

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:12.936
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.438
- This thousand bucks...
- Yeah, thousand.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.371
Double or nothing
he can't make another round.

01:03:16.475 --> 01:03:18.170
- Yeah, thanks anyway.
- Deal. Double or nothing.

01:03:18.277 --> 01:03:20.609
Baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!

01:03:20.913 --> 01:03:23.211
Are you crazy?
You threw away a thousand bucks!

01:03:23.316 --> 01:03:25.341
He can barely stand up in there.

01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:28.147
Look. I really need the money.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.489
I know. Let's work.

01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:34.250
Jesus.

01:03:39.932 --> 01:03:42.025
- Watch that. Watch that.
- I got that.

01:03:55.181 --> 01:03:57.672
- I got it.
- That's a system failure!

01:03:59.352 --> 01:04:01.115
- I don't got it.
- He's going down.

01:04:05.124 --> 01:04:07.718
- Yes!
- No!

01:04:09.962 --> 01:04:11.486
Start the count!

01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:12.996
Start the count!

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:16.535
One! Two! Three!

01:04:16.636 --> 01:04:20.663
Four! Five! Six! Seven!

01:04:20.973 --> 01:04:22.668
Eight! Nine!

01:04:22.975 --> 01:04:23.999
Ten!

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:28.344
You did it! We did it! Wow!

01:04:34.053 --> 01:04:36.248
Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.

01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:41.015
I know, I know! I know! I know!

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:42.651
Kingpin, pay up.

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:46.022
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, I know.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.498
- We owned!
- Let's go. Come on, come on.

01:04:49.735 --> 01:04:51.566
- Yeah?
- Have I got a fight for you.

01:04:51.671 --> 01:04:56.267
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand.
Seven if he wins.

01:04:56.375 --> 01:04:58.309
Four grand? You're on. Let's go!

01:05:07.586 --> 01:05:10.783
Bailey, it's me. He won.

01:05:12.024 --> 01:05:14.185
Can you believe that?
The kid's robot actually won.

01:05:16.095 --> 01:05:17.289
I know.

01:05:20.433 --> 01:05:22.025
Happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.

01:05:22.134 --> 01:05:24.500
He's been bit. He's been bit real bad.

01:05:28.307 --> 01:05:29.331
Anyway...

01:05:31.577 --> 01:05:33.340
I just wanted you to know.

01:06:07.313 --> 01:06:09.213
Jab, jab, hook.

01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:14.413
Jab, jab, hook.

01:06:17.356 --> 01:06:19.119
I think you have to move your feet.

01:06:21.627 --> 01:06:25.654
Your feet. Feet.

01:07:45.578 --> 01:07:46.943
Nice moves, kid.

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:50.612
How long you been out here?

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:53.177
Check it out.

01:07:53.285 --> 01:07:55.583
I just spent the night
doing something I think is amazing.

01:07:55.688 --> 01:07:57.622
Incredibly amazing.
If it works, you know?

01:07:58.457 --> 01:08:00.687
- You know his remote was spotty?
- Yeah.

01:08:00.793 --> 01:08:03.887
I killed it. Got rid of it.
We don't need it any more.

01:08:04.196 --> 01:08:05.356
How did you?

01:08:05.898 --> 01:08:07.729
I had to start over.

01:08:07.833 --> 01:08:10.529
But I was able to use
the spin frame from Ambush

01:08:10.636 --> 01:08:13.298
and take the circuitry sleeve
out of Noisy Boy,

01:08:13.405 --> 01:08:14.463
and it works.

01:08:14.573 --> 01:08:17.667
He knows nothing, but it works.
It really, really works.

01:08:17.776 --> 01:08:18.868
What works?

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:21.776
I got to turn it on.

01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:25.883
Left jab, right uppercut!

01:08:27.953 --> 01:08:28.977
Japan!

01:08:29.288 --> 01:08:31.756
You put Noisy's voice recognition
into Atom?

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:33.950
- Pretty smart, kid.
- Smart?

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.522
It could be genius!

01:08:35.628 --> 01:08:38.392
It could be the most incredible thing
in the history of the entire world!

01:08:38.497 --> 01:08:41.523
Easy there, chief.
Did you drink all these sodas?

01:08:41.634 --> 01:08:44.694
I might have had a few.
I need you to teach him to box.

01:08:44.803 --> 01:08:48.830
Are you kidding me? He's not advanced
enough to handle Noisy's voice command.

01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:51.239
So he needs your moves. Your commands.

01:08:51.343 --> 01:08:53.777
- Start over from the ground up.
- Forget it.

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:55.676
You were a boxer.

01:08:55.781 --> 01:09:00.377
Yesterday at the Zoo, you could see
things happen before they even happened.

01:09:00.486 --> 01:09:02.716
I haven't boxed in a long time.
I'm not starting now.

01:09:02.821 --> 01:09:05.381
- Who's going to teach him to fight?
- You're doing fine.

01:09:05.491 --> 01:09:07.391
You don't need me. Sorry.

01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:13.689
That was really cool,
though, that dance.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.797
You should do that on Saturday night.

01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:19.697
- Don't make fun of me.
- I'm serious.

01:09:19.805 --> 01:09:22.638
Before the fight, when you guys
take the ring, you should do it.

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:25.972
There's no way I'm dancing with a robot
in front of a boxing crowd.

01:09:26.278 --> 01:09:29.475
Are you kidding me? This is just a show.

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.743
People want to see something
they've never seen.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:34.546
Look. You think of all the greats.

01:09:34.653 --> 01:09:37.451
Think Ali, Sugar Ray,
Prince Rakim, Gammer,

01:09:37.556 --> 01:09:39.353
they all had their nicknames.

01:09:39.458 --> 01:09:42.484
They had their personae.
They all had flair.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:46.998
Now you? You might not have much robot,
but with that dance, you got flair.

01:09:47.299 --> 01:09:50.564
Plus, you're a kid.
People love that kid thing.

01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:53.467
- What are you? Like nine? Ten?
- I'm 11.

01:09:53.572 --> 01:09:55.335
Are you sure you're 11?

01:09:56.308 --> 01:09:58.572
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.

01:09:59.712 --> 01:10:02.875
Anyway, the point
is people want to see that.

01:10:06.719 --> 01:10:08.482
You're really not messing with me?

01:10:08.587 --> 01:10:10.919
I am not messing with you.
They're going to love it.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.920
- Cool.
- But...

01:10:16.028 --> 01:10:19.054
- What?
- I won't do it unless you help me.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.331
I can't dance. You're on your own there.

01:10:23.435 --> 01:10:25.027
No. Boxing.

01:10:25.337 --> 01:10:26.634
- Oh, I see.
- I program the robot.

01:10:26.739 --> 01:10:28.900
- You teach him to box.
- And you dance.

01:10:29.008 --> 01:10:30.498
And you dance.

01:10:32.745 --> 01:10:33.905
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:34.013 --> 01:10:35.037
Deal.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:38.374
Deal.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.817
It's going to be cool.

01:11:37.743 --> 01:11:39.074
Nice.

01:11:40.946 --> 01:11:43.813
You're going to be punching guys bigger.
You're going to have to punch up.

01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:45.708
That's it.

01:11:46.785 --> 01:11:47.809
Nice.

01:11:53.492 --> 01:11:54.857
You, too, old man?

01:11:55.928 --> 01:11:57.862
Come on. Let's get to work.

01:12:00.632 --> 01:12:02.725
Nice! Let's do that again.

01:12:04.503 --> 01:12:06.596
Nice. Three-punch combo.

01:12:07.973 --> 01:12:08.997
Combo.

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:11.809
Again. Again.

01:12:12.845 --> 01:12:16.440
Faster. Faster. Nice.

01:12:17.883 --> 01:12:20.044
You're not even out of breath.
I like it.

01:12:20.819 --> 01:12:22.116
Let's see how you move.

01:12:29.128 --> 01:12:30.152
That's good.

01:13:06.064 --> 01:13:08.624
Step around! Left hook! Left hook!

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:26.951
That's it. Every time.

01:13:35.928 --> 01:13:37.520
Upper cut!

01:13:45.003 --> 01:13:46.300
Great fight, fellas.

01:13:54.213 --> 01:13:57.876
105.5, WRUT,
the satellite home of robot boxing.

01:13:57.983 --> 01:13:59.746
Caller two, what do you got for me?

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.979
Have you heard about this little bot
out there, his name is Atom?

01:14:02.087 --> 01:14:03.111
Oh, yeah.

01:14:03.222 --> 01:14:05.850
My buddies and I saw him
the other night, and he dances.

01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:07.926
- Did you say "dances"?
- You heard me.

01:14:08.026 --> 01:14:10.153
He dances pre-fight
with this little kid,

01:14:10.262 --> 01:14:11.820
and the crowd went nuts for these two.

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:14.763
You put the gimmick aside
for a second,

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:17.335
and I'm holding here a list
of the bots he's beaten.

01:14:17.636 --> 01:14:22.130
Chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack.
No slouches on that list, right?

01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:24.072
Atom's fought them all, beat them all.

01:14:24.176 --> 01:14:28.306
This bot is fast! He escapes shots
from these bigger bots, it's insane!

01:14:28.614 --> 01:14:31.606
No doubt. I'm telling you, listeners,
remember this name:

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:36.586
Atom. That's right, A-T-O-M.
This bot is one to watch.

01:14:41.827 --> 01:14:44.125
- Awesome fight, sir.
- Thanks, thanks.

01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:46.026
Great fight.

01:14:46.131 --> 01:14:47.758
- You guys put on a good show.
- Thanks.

01:14:47.866 --> 01:14:49.800
We'd like to invite you
to fight on our card,

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.961
Virgin America Spectrum Detroit,
Friday night.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:55.631
Right. That's a WRB...
That's a League fight.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:59.802
Damn right it is. What do you say,
fellas? You ready for the show?

01:15:01.346 --> 01:15:02.813
Heck, yeah.

01:15:11.323 --> 01:15:14.315
It's the undercard,
but it's still a League fight.

01:15:15.294 --> 01:15:18.320
I just want you to be relaxed.
I want you to be relaxed.

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:21.326
No freaking out.
Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.

01:15:21.633 --> 01:15:23.828
You go freaky-deaky,
this whole thing can go south.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:27.804
Whatever you do, have fun, have fun.
You got to have fun, you understand me?

01:15:27.906 --> 01:15:31.933
We've come too far to get out there
and freak out and blow this whole thing.

01:15:32.044 --> 01:15:35.343
We're going to have fun,
and we're going to not freak out!

01:15:35.647 --> 01:15:38.980
We're going to stay loose,
and we're just going to bam him.

01:15:39.084 --> 01:15:42.349
I've spent my whole life waiting
to get here. We're going to...

01:15:43.288 --> 01:15:47.019
I tell you what. Trust me when
I say no freaking out. You got it?

01:15:47.926 --> 01:15:49.951
- I got it.
- Good.

01:15:50.662 --> 01:15:54.928
You have been invited to Lemkova Suite.
Follow me, please.

01:15:55.934 --> 01:15:57.663
What was that? One more time.

01:15:57.769 --> 01:16:00.203
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.

01:16:00.906 --> 01:16:03.807
Sure. Yeah. Let's head up
to the champ's suite. Sure.

01:16:33.271 --> 01:16:34.363
Wow.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:38.473
- Gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova.
- Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...

01:16:38.777 --> 01:16:40.768
And this, of course, is Tak Mashido.

01:16:40.879 --> 01:16:43.143
Holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.

01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:47.380
I know you have a very important fight
tonight, so I'll get right to it.

01:16:47.686 --> 01:16:51.122
It's a little far from the action for
my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.

01:16:51.223 --> 01:16:55.159
Very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.421
Look at that. You want an autograph?
Would you mind?

01:16:57.729 --> 01:16:59.458
I'd like to buy your robot.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.100
He'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus.
And for that I'm willing to pay.

01:17:07.139 --> 01:17:10.233
$200,000.

01:17:10.342 --> 01:17:11.900
- Done.
- He's not for sale.

01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:14.740
- Of course he is. We can definitely...
- He's not for sale.

01:17:15.347 --> 01:17:20.341
You are 15 minutes away from getting
in the ring with Twin Cities,

01:17:20.452 --> 01:17:22.386
a vicious League bot.

01:17:22.487 --> 01:17:27.925
So, to be clear, my offer stands
until the starting bell.

01:17:28.026 --> 01:17:32.190
OK. And just to be clear,
he's not for sale!

01:17:32.297 --> 01:17:34.424
Not now, not ever.

01:17:35.767 --> 01:17:37.928
Give me a minute to clear this up, OK?

01:17:38.437 --> 01:17:40.928
Tak, how are you? Max!

01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:45.366
Be smart. I know you love him,

01:17:45.477 --> 01:17:48.071
but in 20 minutes
there may be nothing left to love.

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:51.274
- Think about it. Take the offer.
- You think about it.

01:17:52.017 --> 01:17:55.509
Why does she want Atom?
Because he's different from other bots!

01:17:55.821 --> 01:17:57.789
Yeah, he's different.
He's smaller, weaker,

01:17:57.889 --> 01:18:00.016
- and he's going to get his ass kicked.
- He's a boxer.

01:18:00.192 --> 01:18:02.422
We taught him to box.
You taught him to box!

01:18:03.161 --> 01:18:05.129
- That's worth something.
- I think it is, too.

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:08.893
I think it's worth 200 grand.
Two hundred grand.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.969
We can go round and round this
all night long.

01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:13.367
Look at me.

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:16.070
But it's not going to happen.

01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:18.506
I got a fight to get to.

01:18:33.158 --> 01:18:37.060
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,

01:18:37.162 --> 01:18:41.929
the march towards
the Real Steel Championship

01:18:42.033 --> 01:18:45.093
makes its way through Detroit's

01:18:45.203 --> 01:18:49.264
Virgin America Spectrum!

01:18:53.245 --> 01:18:57.579
Kicking off the evening,
in our first undercard,

01:18:57.883 --> 01:19:00.613
the two-headed tyrant,

01:19:00.919 --> 01:19:05.151
Twin Cities!

01:19:35.554 --> 01:19:40.890
Opposing Twin Cities,
in his first professional fight,

01:19:40.992 --> 01:19:44.450
hailing from parts unknown,

01:19:44.563 --> 01:19:46.326
Atom!

01:20:42.053 --> 01:20:43.452
- Nice work, boss.
- Thanks.

01:20:43.555 --> 01:20:45.420
- Did you switch him to fight mode?
- Of course.

01:20:45.523 --> 01:20:48.287
- This bot is tough to put down.
- Atom can do it.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:52.287
Look over there. You see those geeks
with the joysticks and consoles?

01:20:52.397 --> 01:20:54.194
They're controlling
everything their bot does.

01:20:54.299 --> 01:20:55.459
They're monitoring his systems,

01:20:55.567 --> 01:20:58.161
seeing what he sees,
stadium feeds of the fights.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.329
This is not like the underground
handheld remote bots

01:21:00.438 --> 01:21:02.338
we've been fighting.
This is the League. Stand on that.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.408
So what do we do?

01:21:05.176 --> 01:21:08.668
We fight smart, we be patient. And pray.

01:21:10.248 --> 01:21:12.045
Seriously, pray.

01:21:14.519 --> 01:21:15.543
Ready!

01:21:16.688 --> 01:21:18.553
- Ready!
- Hands up.

01:21:18.657 --> 01:21:21.091
Fighters ready! Fight!

01:21:24.663 --> 01:21:26.028
Engage.

01:21:27.265 --> 01:21:32.396
Slip! Right! Lean back.
Right, left! Cover up!

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.030
Duck! Left roundhouse!

01:21:39.678 --> 01:21:41.145
Damn it.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:52.151
Lean left! Lean right!
Cover up! Cover up!

01:21:52.257 --> 01:21:55.192
- What's going on in there?
- He's taking too many hits.

01:22:01.099 --> 01:22:02.327
Get your hands up!

01:22:05.203 --> 01:22:07.068
Get out of that corner! Move!

01:22:10.108 --> 01:22:12.474
He's getting killed in there!
Tell him what to do!

01:22:12.577 --> 01:22:15.410
That guy's got two heads, a foot
of reach on us, and no blind spot.

01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:17.378
He's got to have a weakness. Find it!

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:24.583
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:25.323 --> 01:22:28.224
Right shoulder, right shoulder,
right shoulder! He's got a tell!

01:22:28.326 --> 01:22:30.760
He's got a hitch in his shoulder
every time he throws that right bomb!

01:22:31.062 --> 01:22:33.223
We got him!
See? Here it comes again!

01:22:33.331 --> 01:22:36.095
Duck! Spin!
Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:39.398
Backstep. Backstep.
Backstep. Lean right.

01:22:39.504 --> 01:22:41.529
Come on, Charlie! Get in there!

01:22:41.639 --> 01:22:44.233
Got to get in close where
he can't use that size and reach on us!

01:22:44.342 --> 01:22:47.505
Left to the body! Right to the body!
Left to the body!

01:22:47.612 --> 01:22:49.102
Yeah, it's working!

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.114
Stay downstairs! Left, right, left!

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:55.417
- These program modes aren't working.
- Left! Right hook, slip!

01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:59.183
Right uppercut! Left uppercut!
Duck left. Counter right!

01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:01.850
- Get him, Atom!
- Here comes the Charlie Special.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.129
Three-punch combo to the body!
Out! In! Counter!

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:07.130
- Two-one-two!
- Two-one-two.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:08.665
Stay on him! Lunging right!

01:23:11.536 --> 01:23:14.266
Don't let him go. Right to the body!
Straight right to the head!

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:20.711
We got a systems crash!

01:23:20.812 --> 01:23:22.336
Get him, Atom!

01:23:25.517 --> 01:23:26.814
This is not happening, man.

01:23:27.118 --> 01:23:29.313
- Put him away, Charlie!
- Spin left!

01:23:30.321 --> 01:23:31.583
Spin right!

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:34.816
Finish him!

01:23:35.126 --> 01:23:37.151
- Do it!
- Right uppercut!

01:23:47.372 --> 01:23:48.464
He's down!

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:52.740
One! Two! Three!

01:23:52.844 --> 01:23:55.745
Four! Five! Six!

01:23:55.847 --> 01:23:57.838
We got him. Stay down!

01:24:00.351 --> 01:24:01.750
He's out! He's out!

01:24:07.725 --> 01:24:08.817
Yeah!

01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:13.627
Corner!

01:24:13.731 --> 01:24:16.723
Corner! Corner.

01:24:18.436 --> 01:24:19.630
Victory!

01:24:20.839 --> 01:24:25.173
In a time of one minute, 47 seconds

01:24:25.276 --> 01:24:27.642
of the first round,

01:24:27.745 --> 01:24:29.474
Atom has defeat...

01:24:30.582 --> 01:24:33.380
I want to thank everyone
for coming out tonight!

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:40.220
Our little bot from the junkyard
got a shot at a League fight.

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:41.622
How about that?

01:24:42.827 --> 01:24:47.491
And the last thing I want to say
to a special girl who won't be named,

01:24:47.599 --> 01:24:49.499
Farra Lemkova.

01:24:53.805 --> 01:24:57.571
That instead of buying my robot, using
your money to control this sport...

01:24:57.675 --> 01:24:59.506
- That's it!
- I'm not done.

01:24:59.611 --> 01:25:02.239
Why not give the littlest guy
the biggest shot?

01:25:02.747 --> 01:25:06.649
Because I bet if you give him a shot,
he'll surprise you!

01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:08.343
Wouldn't you like to see a little guy

01:25:08.453 --> 01:25:10.478
get a shot at the
Real Steel Championship?

01:25:14.492 --> 01:25:17.928
I challenge Zeus to a fight.

01:25:19.964 --> 01:25:23.957
Any time, any place, anywhere!

01:25:24.269 --> 01:25:27.261
You name it! We will be there!

01:25:34.913 --> 01:25:36.881
I'm going to get us that fight!

01:25:40.785 --> 01:25:43.811
Atom, Atom, Atom...

01:25:56.701 --> 01:25:58.965
That was a ballsy move,
you challenging Zeus like that.

01:25:59.270 --> 01:26:00.635
That's one thing to call it.

01:26:00.738 --> 01:26:02.000
A lot of people would like to see that.

01:26:02.307 --> 01:26:05.003
- You're damn right they would.
- You listening to this kid? Jeez!

01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:07.005
- Good fight, fellas.
- Thanks, man.

01:26:07.312 --> 01:26:08.973
- Look at this. Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.408
- All right, 70-30, right?
- Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.

01:26:12.517 --> 01:26:14.007
- That's so right.
- That's very funny.

01:26:14.319 --> 01:26:18.380
- I told you we shouldn't have sold him.
- OK. No, no, no.

01:26:18.489 --> 01:26:22.653
I remember now. Who's right?
Say who's right. Say "Max is right."

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.728
All right, all right. All right.

01:26:24.829 --> 01:26:28.424
- We're a good team.
- No, no. Max is right.

01:26:28.666 --> 01:26:30.964
That was unbelievable.
Thank you, Twin Cities.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:34.871
- We set?
- Yeah.

01:26:34.973 --> 01:26:37.339
- Let's do it.
- Charlie boy.

01:26:38.309 --> 01:26:41.608
- Ricky, I was just going to call you.
- Oh, yeah.

01:26:41.713 --> 01:26:44.580
I actually really was going to call you.

01:26:44.716 --> 01:26:46.513
Don't worry about that.

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:48.643
That was a heck of a fight.

01:26:48.753 --> 01:26:51.017
Congratulations to both of you.
That was good.

01:26:51.322 --> 01:26:54.018
It was an amazing fight.
That was a great job, young man.

01:26:54.993 --> 01:26:56.483
- Come on, man.
- What?

01:26:56.594 --> 01:27:00.724
- You serious?
- You thought I was joking

01:27:00.832 --> 01:27:02.629
when I said I'd beat you
within an inch of your life?

01:27:02.734 --> 01:27:05.828
He thought that was a joke.
It wasn't a joke.

01:27:05.937 --> 01:27:10.101
I got a kid here. And I have your money.
We don't have a problem.

01:27:10.408 --> 01:27:12.933
I'm sure you do,

01:27:13.044 --> 01:27:16.070
but I think we know it's about
much more than money, don't we?

01:27:16.381 --> 01:27:21.546
All right. What do you want?
You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.416
- I got the money in cash here.
- Yeah, right.

01:27:23.521 --> 01:27:26.649
Let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!

01:27:26.758 --> 01:27:30.057
- Run! Come on. Keep up, keep up!
- Get him now!

01:27:30.361 --> 01:27:31.623
Run! Come on!

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:35.125
Get off him! Get off him!

01:27:38.569 --> 01:27:39.593
Come here!

01:27:43.908 --> 01:27:45.000
Hey, Ricky.

01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:46.770
That's his money!
Leave him out of this!

01:27:59.090 --> 01:28:01.081
Stop!

01:28:03.594 --> 01:28:04.856
Stop!

01:28:04.962 --> 01:28:08.591
Take all his money. Take it all.

01:28:11.102 --> 01:28:13.662
Your friend's a real dirt bag, kid.

01:28:13.771 --> 01:28:15.432
He's my father!

01:28:17.575 --> 01:28:22.410
Well. Looks like a little less
than an inch of your life.

01:28:22.513 --> 01:28:25.175
Well, buddy, that will teach him.

01:28:30.822 --> 01:28:33.757
Just like old times, Charlie boy!

01:28:33.858 --> 01:28:35.120
Let's go, boys.

01:29:01.052 --> 01:29:05.182
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:47.661
- What are we doing here?
- Max, just...

01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:50.859
Is it Farra? She called you, didn't she?
We're going to get the Zeus fight.

01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:55.132
It's not the Zeus people. I've been
thinking about all this, and...

01:29:57.175 --> 01:29:58.267
Max!

01:30:07.985 --> 01:30:09.816
It's so good to see you.

01:30:09.921 --> 01:30:12.515
- What is she doing here?
- It's better if you go with her now.

01:30:12.623 --> 01:30:14.682
We get beat up,
so you call her to come and get me?

01:30:14.792 --> 01:30:16.692
He's been beat up. I told you
he couldn't take care of him!

01:30:16.794 --> 01:30:19.592
Yeah. I called her.
Look at us. We're a mess.

01:30:19.697 --> 01:30:21.722
We're fine. She can leave!

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:24.859
Atom's fighting good.
We can make the money back.

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:27.570
Charlie, please.

01:30:28.606 --> 01:30:29.698
Just...

01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:35.078
Charlie, we're doing so good.

01:30:37.014 --> 01:30:38.982
Charlie, please, no.

01:30:40.251 --> 01:30:42.913
Don't. Don't. Don't.

01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.856
Please. Please.

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:54.623
Trust me, kid.
It's better this way, all right?

01:30:55.266 --> 01:30:58.133
I know you think you know
what's right, but you don't.

01:30:58.236 --> 01:30:59.897
You're too young. You don't know.

01:31:00.004 --> 01:31:01.665
Look at me, trust me.

01:31:01.772 --> 01:31:05.003
And legally she has custody,
so what can I do?

01:31:05.977 --> 01:31:07.808
What can I do?

01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:24.755
I don't want your money, Marvin.

01:31:25.863 --> 01:31:27.956
Max, we have our own swimming pool

01:31:28.065 --> 01:31:32.764
and we have a hot tub and a lot
of super fun toys to play with.

01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:35.634
Do you want to play with them?
It's going to be fun.

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:37.830
What's going on?

01:31:37.942 --> 01:31:40.706
He won't even talk to me,
so thanks for that, Charlie.

01:31:41.746 --> 01:31:43.179
I'm going to wait in the car.

01:31:45.883 --> 01:31:48.351
You don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.

01:31:48.653 --> 01:31:50.621
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

01:31:50.721 --> 01:31:53.781
You knew from day one what this was.

01:31:53.891 --> 01:31:55.756
You decided to take the ride.

01:31:56.260 --> 01:32:00.128
You thought me, you,
and a little robot from the junk heap

01:32:00.298 --> 01:32:02.789
were going to ride off into the sunset?

01:32:04.835 --> 01:32:07.235
No, you forgot who I was!

01:32:13.311 --> 01:32:14.801
You deserve better...

01:32:16.213 --> 01:32:17.305
than me.

01:32:21.886 --> 01:32:23.683
Will you say something, please?

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:26.222
I tried. What do you want from me?

01:32:26.324 --> 01:32:28.087
I want you to fight for me.

01:32:29.293 --> 01:32:31.158
That's all I ever wanted.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:37.810
Don't ask.

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:41.357
So no Max.

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.355
It's better this way.
Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.

01:34:46.464 --> 01:34:48.295
Did you not see the way
he looked at you?

01:34:49.467 --> 01:34:51.799
That's the way I looked at my dad.

01:34:51.902 --> 01:34:54.097
Even now I would give anything
to have that back.

01:34:54.205 --> 01:34:58.266
Your dad was special.
He was in your corner from day one.

01:34:59.243 --> 01:35:01.040
Me, come on. I blew it.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.312
I blew it.

01:35:05.216 --> 01:35:07.150
When Max was born I just...

01:35:07.852 --> 01:35:09.251
freaked out.

01:35:09.353 --> 01:35:11.548
But something
would have been better than nothing.

01:35:11.856 --> 01:35:13.118
I wouldn't know where to start.

01:35:13.224 --> 01:35:14.248
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't.

01:35:14.358 --> 01:35:15.985
- You do.
- No.

01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:18.053
You do.

01:35:50.995 --> 01:35:52.087
I got to go.

01:35:55.132 --> 01:35:56.599
Twelve hundred miles for a kiss.

01:35:58.202 --> 01:36:00.602
Worth it. Worth it.

01:36:12.049 --> 01:36:13.539
Go get him, Charlie.

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:18.386
You sound like your dad.

01:36:46.617 --> 01:36:50.451
Look, I know you think I abandoned you,

01:36:50.554 --> 01:36:53.421
and I guess I did originally.

01:36:53.524 --> 01:36:54.548
Then you sold me.

01:36:55.259 --> 01:36:56.385
Charlie.

01:36:57.461 --> 01:36:59.429
You have no business being here.

01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:02.090
That's true.
You've got full custody. He's yours.

01:37:02.199 --> 01:37:06.135
And I know I've done all kinds of wrong
by this kid, but if you'll let me...

01:37:08.205 --> 01:37:10.230
I'd just like to do one thing right.

01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:14.268
Right.

01:37:15.946 --> 01:37:17.573
- Where were we?
- You sold me.

01:37:17.681 --> 01:37:19.979
Right, yeah, that happened.

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:22.279
- Wait, what?
- Then we had our asses kicked.

01:37:22.386 --> 01:37:24.547
And you slept on a shelf in a truck,
and it was awful.

01:37:24.655 --> 01:37:26.384
- And dangerous.
- Really dangerous.

01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:30.358
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.

01:37:31.428 --> 01:37:34.420
That's why you came?
To say you're sorry?

01:37:34.531 --> 01:37:37.022
No. I mean, yes. Yes.

01:37:40.037 --> 01:37:43.598
But no. No, I came to tell you
that I heard you.

01:37:44.575 --> 01:37:48.067
I got it.
I'm a little slow, but I got it.

01:37:49.513 --> 01:37:53.108
I know you had a bum ride, and I
wasn't there and I should have been.

01:37:54.351 --> 01:37:55.409
I should have been.

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.144
Your mom was...

01:37:58.656 --> 01:38:00.521
She was cool, wasn't she?

01:38:02.092 --> 01:38:03.150
She was.

01:38:04.028 --> 01:38:05.325
She was the coolest.

01:38:06.163 --> 01:38:08.688
Yeah, she was.

01:38:11.568 --> 01:38:16.562
And I'm sorry about...
what happened with her.

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:22.605
And I can't get those years back, Max,

01:38:22.713 --> 01:38:26.012
but I'm here right now...

01:38:27.384 --> 01:38:30.649
and if you're up for it,
I'm ready to fight.

01:38:44.601 --> 01:38:46.330
We got the Zeus fight.

01:38:46.437 --> 01:38:47.597
What?

01:38:47.705 --> 01:38:49.605
No, no, we didn't.

01:38:50.507 --> 01:38:52.532
You got the Zeus fight.

01:38:56.447 --> 01:38:58.381
So what do you say, Debra?

01:38:58.482 --> 01:39:00.040
Can we do this one last thing?

01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:06.048
- One night.
- It's all we need. Thank you.

01:39:11.095 --> 01:39:14.724
We'll probably get our asses kicked,
but at least we'll go down swinging.

01:39:15.599 --> 01:39:17.726
Yeah? What do you say?

01:39:20.037 --> 01:39:24.371
Welcome to New York's Bing Arena
and the Real Steel Championship Bout.

01:39:24.475 --> 01:39:26.773
Tim, it's the fight
we never thought we'd see.

01:39:27.077 --> 01:39:29.272
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion,

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.645
against the underdog, rising star Atom.

01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:34.650
The champ's handlers
have agreed to fight

01:39:34.752 --> 01:39:37.414
outside the circle
of well-known League bots,

01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:41.651
and have decided to give the people
a true David versus Goliath spectacle.

01:39:41.759 --> 01:39:45.286
Now, Tim, help me out on this.
Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?

01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:47.159
The greatest robot boxer of all time

01:39:47.264 --> 01:39:50.256
gives a shot at the belt
to a G-2 named Atom?

01:39:50.367 --> 01:39:54.303
Well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido,
Team Zeus has lost their minds.

01:39:54.405 --> 01:39:56.669
Now, he may look cool
as he enters the arena,

01:39:56.774 --> 01:39:59.800
but he has made no bones
about his disdain for this match up.

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:02.738
Our cameras tried to catch up
with him earlier this week.

01:40:02.846 --> 01:40:05.838
Look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't
even stop to talk to the press,

01:40:06.150 --> 01:40:09.313
referring only to this fight
as an insult to his creation.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:13.288
Now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer,
did more than just challenge Zeus.

01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:14.618
He did so publicly.

01:40:14.725 --> 01:40:18.422
The challenge went viral and created
a PR nightmare for the champ.

01:40:18.529 --> 01:40:22.192
No argument there. And I think the Zeus
camp knows exactly what they're doing.

01:40:22.299 --> 01:40:23.732
That they do. Come on.

01:40:23.834 --> 01:40:26.860
Giving a shot at the belt
to a nobody from nowhere.

01:40:27.171 --> 01:40:30.265
This "junkyard dog," if you will.
That's a marketing stunt.

01:40:30.374 --> 01:40:33.172
And judging from this crowd,
that stunt is working.

01:40:47.424 --> 01:40:48.789
We can't win, can we?

01:40:49.827 --> 01:40:50.919
We'll see.

01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:57.494
As the challenger
makes his way into the arena,

01:40:57.601 --> 01:40:59.796
you can hear the surge of excitement.

01:41:11.315 --> 01:41:14.614
Atom has arrived
onto the WRB scene with a vengeance,

01:41:14.718 --> 01:41:17.516
using a style,
some would call it human-like,

01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:20.215
that bot fighting has rarely seen.

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:22.519
Atom and his pint-size trainer
step into the ring

01:41:22.626 --> 01:41:25.493
and the look on
Farra Lemkova's face says it all.

01:41:25.596 --> 01:41:27.757
Welcome to the bigs, junior!

01:41:27.865 --> 01:41:30.698
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom
don't make it out the first round.

01:41:30.801 --> 01:41:32.291
Who wants some?

01:41:32.936 --> 01:41:34.631
I'll take some of that action.

01:41:34.738 --> 01:41:37.901
Hey, there!
I'll take some of that action.

01:41:39.243 --> 01:41:42.303
How's it going... partner?

01:41:42.412 --> 01:41:43.777
Partner?

01:41:44.348 --> 01:41:47.511
That's great. How about a hundred K?
Is that funny?

01:41:47.618 --> 01:41:50.280
Hundred K says Atom
doesn't see round two.

01:41:50.387 --> 01:41:52.218
You carrying around
that kind of scratch?

01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:55.720
- Yeah.
- Hundred K?

01:41:56.426 --> 01:42:00.658
Tell you what.
Remember section 101, row C,

01:42:00.764 --> 01:42:03.460
and you can bring me
my money right to my seat.

01:42:03.567 --> 01:42:06.934
101, row C? Hundred K?

01:42:07.704 --> 01:42:08.966
You heard me, homey.

01:42:09.273 --> 01:42:10.934
- Homey?
- Right?

01:42:11.241 --> 01:42:12.401
Homeboy!

01:42:13.577 --> 01:42:15.909
All right. Peace out, posse.

01:42:16.213 --> 01:42:17.510
Come on, sugar. Let's go.

01:42:41.305 --> 01:42:43.933
- Never beaten.
- It's showtime!

01:42:44.241 --> 01:42:46.334
Never threatened.

01:42:46.443 --> 01:42:49.606
The king of the ring,

01:42:49.713 --> 01:42:51.840
the ruler of robots!

01:42:53.016 --> 01:42:58.352
Bow down to the mighty Zeus!

01:43:23.981 --> 01:43:25.005
Oh, shit!

01:43:31.588 --> 01:43:32.885
That was awesome.

01:43:39.563 --> 01:43:40.723
Come on, let's go.

01:43:47.504 --> 01:43:50.064
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:43:50.374 --> 01:43:52.899
in a bout scheduled for five rounds

01:43:53.010 --> 01:43:56.446
for the World Robot
Boxing Championship,

01:43:56.546 --> 01:44:01.074
in the corner to my right,
the challenger, Atom!

01:44:01.318 --> 01:44:02.444
Showboat!

01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:08.790
And in the corner to my left,

01:44:08.892 --> 01:44:11.918
the undeniable champion
of this universe

01:44:12.029 --> 01:44:15.624
and any other universe known
or unknown,

01:44:15.732 --> 01:44:19.964
the mighty Zeus!

01:44:24.541 --> 01:44:28.739
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
are you ready

01:44:28.845 --> 01:44:33.839
for Real Steel!

01:44:36.787 --> 01:44:37.947
This is what it's all about!

01:44:38.055 --> 01:44:42.048
There's the starting bell
and we are underway.

01:44:42.359 --> 01:44:44.088
The bots emerge from their corners.

01:44:44.995 --> 01:44:48.055
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.

01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:49.491
On your feet!

01:44:49.599 --> 01:44:52.067
Looks like we are in
for another Zeus clinic.

01:44:54.538 --> 01:44:56.938
Referee Matt Geiger
coming in the ring to start the count.

01:44:58.008 --> 01:44:59.066
Get up!

01:45:00.744 --> 01:45:02.905
Push up! Stand up!

01:45:03.947 --> 01:45:06.541
But look at this.
The little bot's back on his feet

01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:09.118
to get a second blistering attack
from Zeus!

01:45:09.419 --> 01:45:12.411
Atom is down for the second time
in less than ten seconds.

01:45:12.522 --> 01:45:16.481
- He's too strong!
- That's my boy right there!

01:45:18.495 --> 01:45:20.019
Get up and get in the game!

01:45:20.130 --> 01:45:23.156
Come on! No, please Atom, get up!
Please!

01:45:23.467 --> 01:45:25.992
Get up! Get up! Get up!

01:45:27.637 --> 01:45:31.038
Once again,
the challenger finds his feet!

01:45:31.641 --> 01:45:32.665
Lean back!

01:45:32.776 --> 01:45:35.074
Atom's getting pummeled into the corner!

01:45:35.178 --> 01:45:37.544
- Get out of there!
- Move!

01:45:39.816 --> 01:45:41.875
A demolishing inside shot.

01:45:41.985 --> 01:45:43.111
Get your hands up!

01:45:45.122 --> 01:45:46.680
Hands up!

01:45:47.624 --> 01:45:49.057
Crush that little can!

01:45:49.159 --> 01:45:50.649
Get out of the corner!

01:45:50.761 --> 01:45:54.060
Kenton desperately trying to command
his robot out of that suicide corner.

01:45:59.002 --> 01:46:00.060
Get your feet under you!

01:46:01.738 --> 01:46:03.797
Good night, sparring bot!

01:46:03.907 --> 01:46:06.637
It might have taken Zeus a bit longer,
but he's done it again!

01:46:06.743 --> 01:46:10.076
Atom is down for the third
and possibly final time tonight.

01:46:10.180 --> 01:46:12.546
- Stand up!
- Two!

01:46:12.649 --> 01:46:14.048
Three!

01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:15.516
Atom, get up!

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:17.678
- Get up, Atom.
- Get up, Atom.

01:46:18.188 --> 01:46:21.055
- Six! Seven!
- Get up!

01:46:21.158 --> 01:46:23.058
Eight! Nine!

01:46:24.094 --> 01:46:28.622
I don't believe this! Against all odds,
this little bot is on his feet again.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:30.892
Come on, Atom!

01:46:34.037 --> 01:46:35.197
He can't survive this!

01:46:39.009 --> 01:46:41.204
- Come on, Charlie!
- Right uppercut!

01:46:42.646 --> 01:46:45.240
Atom has landed a punch!

01:46:45.549 --> 01:46:50.577
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from
an uppercut that he never saw coming!

01:46:50.687 --> 01:46:52.120
Advance!

01:46:52.222 --> 01:46:53.712
Fade back, counter right!

01:46:54.524 --> 01:46:55.684
Fade back, counter right!

01:46:56.526 --> 01:47:00.963
Right cross! Right cross!
Right cross! Left hook!

01:47:01.064 --> 01:47:03.931
- Let's go! Come on!
- Take him down!

01:47:04.601 --> 01:47:06.660
For the first time in his dominant run,

01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:10.638
Zeus has met a bot
who simply won't back down!

01:47:12.275 --> 01:47:15.108
The crowd is going nuts!
Zeus gives it everything he's got

01:47:15.212 --> 01:47:18.181
as we reach the last 15 seconds
of round one!

01:47:18.281 --> 01:47:22.240
Zeus corners Atom,
going double duty with both fists!

01:47:22.552 --> 01:47:25.544
Downtown, uptown,
as the clock winds down!

01:47:25.655 --> 01:47:28.715
- Hands up, chin down.
- Stay low, stay low!

01:47:32.229 --> 01:47:37.292
Only five seconds left, as here comes
that piston-packed right of the champ!

01:47:38.835 --> 01:47:42.999
There's the bell! I don't believe it.
Somehow Atom has survived.

01:47:43.106 --> 01:47:48.169
We will have a second round.
And the crowd here is thrilled!

01:47:51.281 --> 01:47:54.614
He made it! Yeah! Corner!

01:47:56.086 --> 01:47:59.920
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here now!

01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:05.024
We got to go this way. Come on!

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:11.897
OK, you sit down.

01:48:15.071 --> 01:48:17.767
- Let's go, homey.
- All right.

01:48:17.874 --> 01:48:19.307
I'll be back for you, baby.

01:48:20.277 --> 01:48:22.609
Get your hands off me!

01:48:25.015 --> 01:48:27.950
Both corners furiously working
on their bots.

01:48:28.051 --> 01:48:31.384
This crowd came here tonight
expecting a massacre,

01:48:31.688 --> 01:48:33.679
but instead they're getting a war!

01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:35.121
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:48:35.225 --> 01:48:36.249
All right. Here we go.

01:48:36.359 --> 01:48:38.657
What is happening?

01:48:38.762 --> 01:48:43.756
He is fully prepared for all possible
contingencies. He will be fine.

01:48:43.867 --> 01:48:45.164
What next?

01:48:46.036 --> 01:48:47.333
Round two.

01:48:55.645 --> 01:48:58.944
Round two kicks off,
and incredibly the challenger, Atom,

01:48:59.049 --> 01:49:01.074
is giving the champ a run for his money.

01:49:02.819 --> 01:49:06.414
Zeus tosses the smaller bot
across the ring like a tin can!

01:49:10.193 --> 01:49:15.187
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta
of straight rights to the champ's dome!

01:49:20.236 --> 01:49:24.229
Toe-to-toe they stand,
trading deafening blows!

01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:31.076
Whatever strategy either corner
had cooked up has been destroyed!

01:49:33.917 --> 01:49:37.250
Metal bashing metal.
Steel smashing steel.

01:49:37.354 --> 01:49:39.754
This is a brawl!

01:49:42.359 --> 01:49:47.262
The crowd is on their feet, watching two
machines driven to kill each other!

01:49:47.364 --> 01:49:50.060
Something has to give, and it does!

01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:51.997
Atom goes down again!

01:49:52.102 --> 01:49:56.232
Lights out for the junkyard dog who put
on a heck of a show here tonight!

01:49:58.341 --> 01:50:01.003
And yet again, Atom rises up.

01:50:01.111 --> 01:50:05.707
Kenton must have hardwired
this bot with the will to go on!

01:50:12.022 --> 01:50:17.050
Midway through round four, and Zeus
is looking to end this thing right now.

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.494
The champ is holding nothing back
as he cracks open the hurt locker!

01:50:31.775 --> 01:50:35.472
Atom is stumbling around the ring,
apparently disoriented and dazed!

01:50:35.779 --> 01:50:37.178
- Hands up!
- What's going on?

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:40.215
I think the voice recog is shot!
He's not responding!

01:50:43.453 --> 01:50:48.220
Zeus has found yet another gear of
violence, drilling Atom's midsection.

01:50:48.324 --> 01:50:51.521
No! Stop! Do something!

01:50:51.828 --> 01:50:52.852
He can't hear me!

01:50:54.197 --> 01:50:59.829
But the bell sounds, and once again
this little robot has stunned the world!

01:51:01.938 --> 01:51:06.341
We're done, Max! He can't hear me.
This is murder. We've had enough.

01:51:06.443 --> 01:51:09.003
- I'm disabling the voice recognition.
- He can't hear me!

01:51:09.112 --> 01:51:11.444
- Yes, but he can see you!
- What?

01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:15.817
I'm putting him in shadow mode.
Show him what to do.

01:51:15.919 --> 01:51:18.285
Without the voice recognition,
he'll move even faster!

01:51:18.388 --> 01:51:19.548
No way. No way!

01:51:19.856 --> 01:51:21.824
Look at them. They are freaking out!

01:51:22.325 --> 01:51:24.384
Rich girl is ripping him
a new one over there!

01:51:24.494 --> 01:51:26.519
Do you know why?
Because they're scared.

01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:28.991
Because Atom can do things
no other bot has ever done.

01:51:29.099 --> 01:51:30.964
- But I can't do it!
- Yes, you can.

01:51:31.067 --> 01:51:33.865
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:51:35.004 --> 01:51:38.462
Show him what to do.
You have to fight the last round.

01:51:38.775 --> 01:51:40.140
Don't ask me. Don't.

01:51:40.243 --> 01:51:44.839
Charlie... please. I beg you.

01:51:53.490 --> 01:51:54.980
Are you kidding me with those eyes?

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.327
Damn it!

01:51:58.428 --> 01:51:59.486
Yes!

01:52:00.296 --> 01:52:01.888
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:52:02.966 --> 01:52:05.332
I know you're in there! I'm not sure
if you're getting this or what,

01:52:05.435 --> 01:52:06.868
but I know you're in there!

01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:09.234
- Kenton. In or out?
- In. Give me a minute.

01:52:12.842 --> 01:52:17.404
I know you can't hear me,
but you can see me, so watch me!

01:52:17.514 --> 01:52:20.176
Watch... me.

01:52:20.283 --> 01:52:23.946
- You know you're talking to a robot.
- I know. Shut up.

01:52:25.054 --> 01:52:26.612
Watch me.

01:52:27.090 --> 01:52:29.081
An epic battle being waged here tonight,

01:52:29.192 --> 01:52:31.285
as the fifth and final round
gets underway.

01:52:31.394 --> 01:52:33.021
Come on, Atom!

01:52:42.539 --> 01:52:44.939
Wait a second. Are you seeing this?

01:52:45.041 --> 01:52:48.169
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing
just outside the ring!

01:52:48.278 --> 01:52:50.473
It looks like Atom
has a shadow function.

01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.447
So, basically,
that means Charlie Kenton

01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:56.417
is fighting the last round
of this fight against Zeus.

01:52:56.519 --> 01:53:01.115
It doesn't seem to help, because Atom
is backed up against the ropes again.

01:53:03.159 --> 01:53:05.059
Help him! Fight back!

01:53:05.161 --> 01:53:06.253
Not yet.

01:53:09.866 --> 01:53:13.597
Tak Mashido supervising personally
as Zeus hammers down,

01:53:13.903 --> 01:53:16.633
furiously trying to end this thing
once and for all.

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:20.666
I got to tell you, folks,
the champ looks tired.

01:53:20.977 --> 01:53:23.207
This robot seems to be running on empty.

01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:29.382
I don't believe it.
Atom is taunting Zeus.

01:53:29.485 --> 01:53:33.114
- Switch to turbo!
- He's actually asking for more.

01:53:35.091 --> 01:53:36.615
Please do something!

01:53:36.926 --> 01:53:39.156
- Not yet.
- That's right, Charlie. Not yet.

01:53:41.931 --> 01:53:43.296
Nitrous pistons, now!

01:53:46.436 --> 01:53:48.404
He's not going to last much longer!

01:53:48.504 --> 01:53:50.438
- Fight back!
- Not yet.

01:53:51.207 --> 01:53:52.469
Hang in there!

01:53:52.575 --> 01:53:58.036
Atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled
Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!

01:53:59.215 --> 01:54:03.049
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!

01:54:06.356 --> 01:54:08.483
Wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!

01:54:11.094 --> 01:54:13.187
Zeus is slowing down!

01:54:13.296 --> 01:54:16.163
The champ's power core
is clearly depleted.

01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:17.324
Charlie, please!

01:54:19.569 --> 01:54:20.661
Hey, kid.

01:54:21.537 --> 01:54:23.129
- Now.
- Now!

01:54:28.411 --> 01:54:29.469
Get in there!

01:54:32.048 --> 01:54:34.312
Knock that little bitch! Bust him open!

01:54:43.259 --> 01:54:44.624
Yeah! That's right!

01:54:46.195 --> 01:54:47.423
Do something!

01:54:48.298 --> 01:54:49.356
Move!

01:54:50.733 --> 01:54:53.224
Override. Switching to manual.

01:54:55.271 --> 01:55:00.106
In a shocking move, Tak Mashido is
manually operating his robot personally!

01:55:10.553 --> 01:55:13.249
- Work the body! Get inside him!
- Get him, Atom!

01:55:15.024 --> 01:55:19.518
Look at this! The champ is trying
desperately to stay on his feet,

01:55:19.629 --> 01:55:24.794
but Kenton is relentless, landing
blow after blow after blow to the body!

01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:09.371
Left! Right! Left! Right!

01:56:09.479 --> 01:56:14.644
A huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!

01:56:19.355 --> 01:56:22.518
This little bot has
dug deep here tonight

01:56:22.625 --> 01:56:25.355
and shown something damn near heart!

01:56:25.461 --> 01:56:29.659
One, two, three,

01:56:29.766 --> 01:56:34.703
four, five, six, seven...

01:56:34.804 --> 01:56:35.828
He's good!

01:56:36.139 --> 01:56:39.472
Zeus gets to his feet,
but Kenton has Atom on him again,

01:56:39.575 --> 01:56:41.338
landing punch after punch!

01:56:41.444 --> 01:56:43.810
Tak Mashido and his super bot
have no answer.

01:56:44.113 --> 01:56:47.207
Zeus pins Atom's left arm,
but Kenton is undaunted!

01:56:47.316 --> 01:56:50.285
It all comes down to this, folks!

01:56:50.386 --> 01:56:52.286
Drop him, Charlie! Now!

01:56:52.388 --> 01:56:55.380
- Kenton is about to drop the champ...
- No! There's the bell!

01:56:56.426 --> 01:56:58.621
Zeus is saved by the bell!

01:57:05.535 --> 01:57:08.436
Amazingly, we will go
to the judges' cards!

01:57:22.118 --> 01:57:25.884
Ladies and gentlemen,
after five rounds,

01:57:26.189 --> 01:57:28.749
we go to the judges' scorecards.

01:57:32.695 --> 01:57:37.257
Judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.

01:57:37.366 --> 01:57:42.326
Judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.

01:57:42.438 --> 01:57:47.171
And Judge Number Three
scores the fight 47-46,

01:57:47.276 --> 01:57:52.475
for the winner
and still World Robot Boxing champion,

01:57:52.582 --> 01:57:54.880
Zeus!

01:58:02.325 --> 01:58:04.486
Farra Lemkova,

01:58:04.594 --> 01:58:06.892
you got way more
than you bargained for tonight.

01:58:07.196 --> 01:58:10.563
Some would say that your bot
won the decision but lost the fight.

01:58:11.334 --> 01:58:12.596
She looks pissed.

01:58:13.302 --> 01:58:15.532
It took a little longer
than we thought,

01:58:15.638 --> 01:58:18.835
but the result is as expected.

01:58:20.276 --> 01:58:24.645
We won. Zeus is still undefeated.

01:58:29.919 --> 01:58:33.252
Any comment on the absolutely
humiliating near loss

01:58:33.356 --> 01:58:34.618
your bot suffered tonight?

01:58:37.627 --> 01:58:40.255
- Nothing.
- No comment.

01:58:40.363 --> 01:58:41.694
Max. Where's Max?

01:58:45.368 --> 01:58:46.528
There he is. Max.

01:58:48.304 --> 01:58:51.705
They're already calling your bot
"the people's champion."

01:58:55.244 --> 01:58:57.007
What do you say to that?

01:58:57.980 --> 01:58:59.470
People's champion?

01:59:01.918 --> 01:59:03.442
Sounds pretty good to me.

01:59:09.358 --> 01:59:11.417
Dad? Dad!

01:59:15.398 --> 01:59:16.558
Dad!

01:59:27.476 --> 01:59:29.000
I really want you to know...

01:59:29.312 --> 01:59:31.371
No, I need you to know.

01:59:33.482 --> 01:59:34.710
Don't worry.

01:59:35.718 --> 01:59:37.481
Your secret's safe with me.

01:59:44.527 --> 01:59:46.290
Wait here. Wait here.

02:00:30.973 --> 02:00:32.668
Yes!
