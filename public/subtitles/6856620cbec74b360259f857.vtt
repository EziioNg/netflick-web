00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.925
Sméagol!

00:01:19.093 --> 00:01:21.335
I've got one!

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:23.964
I've got a fish, Sméag. Sméagol!

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.260
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on.
Pull it in.

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:37.312
Déagol!

00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.537
Déagol?

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.332
Déagol.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.226
Give us that, Déagol, my love.

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:05.479
Why?

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:08.818
Because...

00:03:08.995 --> 00:03:12.743
...it's my birthday and I wants it.

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:52.043
My precious.

00:04:59.605 --> 00:05:02.523
They cursed us.

00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:04.067
Murderer.

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:06.690
"Murderer" they called us.

00:05:06.862 --> 00:05:11.655
They cursed us
and drove us away.

00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:14.493
Gollum.

00:05:14.662 --> 00:05:16.370
Gollum.

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.496
Gollum.

00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:25.045
And we wept, precious.

00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:28.797
We wept to be so alone.

00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:35.171
-- And cool
So nice for feet

00:05:36.183 --> 00:05:40.561
And we only wish
To catch a fish

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.980
So juicy sweet

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:53.867
And we forgot the taste of bread...

00:05:54.034 --> 00:05:57.653
...the sound of trees...

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.742
...the softness of the wind.

00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:08.046
We even forgot our own name.

00:06:16.182 --> 00:06:22.599
My precious.

00:07:06.857 --> 00:07:09.099
Wake up!

00:07:10.152 --> 00:07:11.812
Wake up!

00:07:11.987 --> 00:07:13.779
Wake up, sleepies.

00:07:13.948 --> 00:07:15.821
We must go, yes.

00:07:15.991 --> 00:07:18.661
We must go at once.

00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:25.290
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

00:07:27.503 --> 00:07:30.041
I've gone and had too much.

00:07:31.423 --> 00:07:33.167
Must be getting late.

00:07:33.342 --> 00:07:34.836
No.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.919
It isn't.

00:07:37.096 --> 00:07:40.132
It isn't midday yet.

00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:42.881
The days are growing darker.

00:07:47.147 --> 00:07:49.354
Come on!

00:07:51.777 --> 00:07:54.019
Must go! No time!

00:07:54.196 --> 00:07:56.568
Not before Mr. Frodo's
had something to eat.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.611
No time to lose, silly.

00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:09.657
Here.

00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:14.708
What about you?

00:08:14.883 --> 00:08:18.252
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:20.221
Sam.

00:08:22.808 --> 00:08:24.350
All right.

00:08:24.518 --> 00:08:27.009
We don't have that much left.

00:08:27.187 --> 00:08:30.058
We have to be careful
or we're going to run out.

00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:35.152
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.731
I've rationed it.

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:38.899
There should be enough.

00:08:41.076 --> 00:08:42.274
For what?

00:08:43.954 --> 00:08:45.697
The journey home.

00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:55.872
Come, Hobbitses.

00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:59.133
Very close now.

00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:02.553
Very close to Mordor.

00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:05.392
No safe places here.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:07.717
Hurry.

00:10:00.113 --> 00:10:01.821
It's good.

00:10:02.741 --> 00:10:04.484
Definitely from the Shire.

00:10:06.703 --> 00:10:08.826
Longbottom Leaf.

00:10:14.169 --> 00:10:18.498
I feel like I'm back at
The Green Dragon.

00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:22.841
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:27.590
Putting my feet up on a settle
after a hard day's work.

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:31.634
Only, you've never done
a hard day's work.

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:47.486
Welcome, my lords...

00:10:47.661 --> 00:10:49.903
...to Isengard!

00:10:50.288 --> 00:10:54.037
You young rascals!
A merry hunt you've led us on...

00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:59.204
...and now we find you feasting
and...and smoking!

00:10:59.381 --> 00:11:02.548
We are sitting on a field of victory...

00:11:02.718 --> 00:11:06.217
...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:11.137
The salted pork is particularly good.

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:14.057
Salted pork?

00:11:15.272 --> 00:11:18.688
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

00:11:18.859 --> 00:11:21.694
...who's taken over management
of Isengard.

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:27.240
Young Master Gandalf.

00:11:27.409 --> 00:11:31.987
I'm glad you've come.

00:11:32.164 --> 00:11:36.576
Wood and water, stock and stone
I can master.

00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:40.417
But there is a wizard to manage here...

00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:42.581
...locked in his tower.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.588
Show yourself.

00:11:46.845 --> 00:11:48.553
Be careful.

00:11:49.347 --> 00:11:52.017
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

00:11:52.184 --> 00:11:54.307
Well, let's just have his head
and be done with it.

00:11:54.478 --> 00:11:56.517
No.

00:11:56.855 --> 00:11:59.180
We need him alive.

00:12:00.192 --> 00:12:02.765
We need him to talk.

00:12:04.654 --> 00:12:08.866
You have fought many wars
and slain many men, Théoden King...

00:12:09.034 --> 00:12:10.528
...and made peace afterwards.

00:12:10.702 --> 00:12:15.660
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

00:12:15.832 --> 00:12:19.035
Can we not have peace, you and I?

00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:21.120
We shall have peace.

00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:25.171
We shall have peace...

00:12:25.342 --> 00:12:29.386
...when you answer
for the burning of the Westfold...

00:12:29.554 --> 00:12:32.306
...and the children that lie dead there!

00:12:33.058 --> 00:12:37.221
We shall have peace
when the lives of the soldiers...

00:12:37.395 --> 00:12:39.471
...whose bodies were hewn
even as they lay dead...

00:12:39.648 --> 00:12:43.182
...against the gates of the Hornburg,
are avenged!

00:12:44.736 --> 00:12:50.323
When you hang from a gibbet
for the sport of your own crows...

00:12:51.242 --> 00:12:53.484
...we shall have peace.

00:12:56.247 --> 00:12:58.952
Gibbets and crows?

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:00.537
Dotard!

00:13:02.003 --> 00:13:04.838
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.331
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.427
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...

00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:15.594
...along with the crowns of the seven kings
and the rods of the Five Wizards!

00:13:15.767 --> 00:13:18.721
Your treachery has already cost
many lives.

00:13:18.895 --> 00:13:21.267
Thousands more are now at risk.

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:23.811
But you could save them, Saruman.

00:13:23.984 --> 00:13:26.272
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

00:13:26.444 --> 00:13:29.730
So you have come here for information.

00:13:30.615 --> 00:13:32.442
I have some for you.

00:13:37.914 --> 00:13:40.868
Something festers
in the heart of Middle-earth.

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:43.284
Something that you have failed to see.

00:13:45.797 --> 00:13:49.296
But the Great Eye has seen it.

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:54.044
Even now he presses his advantage.

00:13:55.807 --> 00:13:59.140
His attack will come soon.

00:14:01.354 --> 00:14:03.477
You're all going to die.

00:14:05.984 --> 00:14:09.234
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

00:14:09.404 --> 00:14:14.030
You cannot think that this Ranger
will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.286
This exile, crept from the shadows,
will never be crowned king.

00:14:21.624 --> 00:14:25.289
Gandalf does not hesitate
to sacrifice those closest to him...

00:14:26.212 --> 00:14:28.419
...those he professes to love.

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:34.009
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:37.215
...before you sent him to his doom?

00:14:39.642 --> 00:14:44.351
The path that you have set him on
can only lead to death.

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:46.847
I've heard enough!

00:14:47.025 --> 00:14:48.852
Shoot him.
Stick an arrow in his gob.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.020
No.

00:14:51.487 --> 00:14:53.694
Come down, Saruman...

00:14:53.865 --> 00:14:57.815
- ...and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

00:14:57.994 --> 00:14:59.322
I have no use for it!

00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:10.005
Saruman...

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:14.215
...your staff is broken.

00:15:25.104 --> 00:15:28.556
Grima, you need not follow him.

00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:32.403
You were not always as you are now.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.405
You were once a Man of Rohan.

00:15:35.573 --> 00:15:36.818
Come down.

00:15:36.991 --> 00:15:39.696
A Man of Rohan?

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.862
What is the house of Rohan...

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:46.704
...but a thatched barn
where brigands drink in the reek...

00:15:46.876 --> 00:15:50.577
...and their brats roll on the floor
with the dogs?

00:15:51.089 --> 00:15:57.542
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.

00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:02.758
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

00:16:05.103 --> 00:16:06.811
Grima...

00:16:07.647 --> 00:16:09.521
...come down.

00:16:09.857 --> 00:16:11.268
Be free of him.

00:16:11.442 --> 00:16:15.440
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

00:16:15.822 --> 00:16:18.443
Get down, cur!

00:16:20.201 --> 00:16:21.481
Saruman!

00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:24.282
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:26.947
Tell us what you know!

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:33.702
You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you
where your doom will be decided.

00:16:33.881 --> 00:16:37.416
I will not be held prisoner here.

00:17:04.537 --> 00:17:06.079
Send word to all our allies...

00:17:06.247 --> 00:17:09.164
...and to every corner of Middle-earth
that still stands free.

00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.829
The enemy moves against us.
We need to know where he will strike.

00:17:32.023 --> 00:17:35.972
The filth of Saruman...

00:17:36.152 --> 00:17:39.984
...is washing away.

00:17:40.156 --> 00:17:44.699
Trees will come back to live here.

00:17:45.203 --> 00:17:47.361
Young trees.

00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:49.745
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

00:17:59.217 --> 00:18:01.375
Bless my bark!

00:18:01.552 --> 00:18:03.426
Peregrin Took!

00:18:03.596 --> 00:18:06.217
I'll take that, my lad.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.264
Quickly, now.

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:04.029
Tonight we remember those who
gave their blood to defend this country.

00:19:04.699 --> 00:19:06.738
Hail the victorious dead.

00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:08.320
Hail!

00:19:19.296 --> 00:19:21.206
No pauses.

00:19:21.382 --> 00:19:25.545
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

00:19:26.053 --> 00:19:27.713
So it's a drinking game?

00:19:29.265 --> 00:19:31.969
Last one standing wins.

00:19:36.313 --> 00:19:38.306
What'll we drink to?
Let's drink to victory!

00:19:38.482 --> 00:19:39.893
To victory!

00:20:23.861 --> 00:20:25.521
I am happy for you.

00:20:25.905 --> 00:20:28.312
He is an honourable man.

00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:31.196
You are both honourable men.

00:20:33.037 --> 00:20:38.375
It was not Théoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:48.377
Don't listen to me.

00:20:49.219 --> 00:20:50.714
You are young.

00:20:50.888 --> 00:20:53.213
And tonight is for you.

00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:09.231
Here, here.

00:21:10.741 --> 00:21:16.660
It's the Dwarves that go swimming
with little, hairy women.

00:21:22.044 --> 00:21:23.289
I feel something.

00:21:25.422 --> 00:21:27.913
A slight tingle in my fingers.

00:21:28.634 --> 00:21:30.211
I think it's affecting me.

00:21:32.137 --> 00:21:33.845
What did I say?

00:21:34.014 --> 00:21:37.348
He can't hold his liquor.

00:21:44.692 --> 00:21:46.020
Game over.

00:21:46.193 --> 00:21:49.609
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.730
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:58.286
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

00:21:58.455 --> 00:22:02.370
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink 'em by the flagon

00:22:02.543 --> 00:22:05.709
But the only brew for the brave and true

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.621
Pippin!

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:13.128
But the only brew for the brave and true

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.175
Comes from The Green Dragon

00:22:18.892 --> 00:22:21.727
Thank you! I win!

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.971
No news of Frodo?

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.649
No word. Nothing.

00:22:30.487 --> 00:22:32.646
We have time.

00:22:34.158 --> 00:22:37.443
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

00:22:38.203 --> 00:22:40.279
Do we know that?

00:22:44.126 --> 00:22:45.834
What does your heart tell you?

00:22:52.885 --> 00:22:56.218
That Frodo is alive.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.181
Yes.

00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:04.928
Yes, he's alive.

00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:10.026
Too risky. Too risky.

00:23:10.193 --> 00:23:11.438
Thieves.

00:23:11.612 --> 00:23:13.651
They stole it from us.

00:23:13.822 --> 00:23:17.321
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

00:23:19.369 --> 00:23:22.204
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:24.910
Mustn't ruin it now.

00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:27.159
But they knows.

00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:29.209
They knows.

00:23:29.379 --> 00:23:32.001
They suspects us.

00:23:33.216 --> 00:23:36.751
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

00:23:36.929 --> 00:23:40.511
Is Sméagol losing his nerve?

00:23:41.183 --> 00:23:43.555
No. Not.

00:23:43.727 --> 00:23:47.974
Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

00:23:48.148 --> 00:23:52.976
Sméagol wants to see them dead.

00:23:53.153 --> 00:23:55.691
And we will.

00:23:55.864 --> 00:23:59.909
Sméagol did it once.
He can do it again.

00:24:03.246 --> 00:24:05.916
It's ours!

00:24:06.083 --> 00:24:08.752
Ours!

00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:12.749
We must get the precious.
We must get it back.

00:24:12.923 --> 00:24:16.339
Patience! Patience, my love.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:20.887
First we must lead them to her.

00:24:21.765 --> 00:24:26.759
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

00:24:26.937 --> 00:24:29.606
Yes, the stairs. And then?

00:24:29.773 --> 00:24:32.774
Up, up, up, up,
up the stairs we go...

00:24:32.943 --> 00:24:39.361
...until we come to the tunnel.

00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:42.861
And when they go in...

00:24:43.036 --> 00:24:45.823
...there's no coming out.

00:24:46.748 --> 00:24:49.619
She's always hungry.

00:24:50.377 --> 00:24:54.588
She always needs to feed.

00:24:54.756 --> 00:24:56.167
She must eat.

00:24:56.341 --> 00:24:58.464
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

00:24:58.635 --> 00:25:01.387
And they doesn't taste very nice,
does they, precious?

00:25:02.013 --> 00:25:03.638
No.

00:25:03.807 --> 00:25:08.516
Not very nice at all, my love.

00:25:08.687 --> 00:25:11.474
She hungers for sweeter meats.

00:25:11.648 --> 00:25:13.475
Hobbit meat.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.478
And when she throws away the bones
and the empty clothes...

00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:21.739
...then we will find it.

00:25:21.908 --> 00:25:26.238
And take it for me!

00:25:27.998 --> 00:25:29.408
For us.

00:25:29.916 --> 00:25:32.917
Yes. We meant "for us."

00:25:33.086 --> 00:25:36.537
Gollum. Gollum.

00:25:36.715 --> 00:25:41.211
The precious will be ours...

00:25:41.386 --> 00:25:45.882
...once the Hobbitses are dead!

00:25:46.391 --> 00:25:47.850
You treacherous little toad!

00:25:50.562 --> 00:25:52.851
No! No! Master!

00:25:53.023 --> 00:25:54.647
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

00:25:55.525 --> 00:25:58.194
I heard it from his own mouth.
He means to murder us.

00:25:58.361 --> 00:26:02.525
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

00:26:04.034 --> 00:26:06.607
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

00:26:06.786 --> 00:26:08.364
...who hates Sméagol...

00:26:08.538 --> 00:26:11.325
...and who makes up nasty lies.

00:26:11.499 --> 00:26:14.169
You miserable little maggot!
I'll stove your head in!

00:26:14.544 --> 00:26:15.825
Sam!

00:26:16.212 --> 00:26:18.501
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

00:26:19.466 --> 00:26:23.380
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

00:26:23.553 --> 00:26:26.720
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

00:26:27.057 --> 00:26:28.385
You don't see it, do you?

00:26:28.808 --> 00:26:30.219
He's a villain.

00:26:31.227 --> 00:26:34.846
We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.
Not without a guide.

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.561
I need you on my side.

00:26:39.361 --> 00:26:41.686
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

00:26:43.198 --> 00:26:46.152
I know, Sam. I know.

00:26:46.701 --> 00:26:48.694
Trust me.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.242
Come, Sméagol.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:00.649
What time is it?

00:28:02.986 --> 00:28:04.480
Not yet dawn.

00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:14.447
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

00:28:14.622 --> 00:28:18.620
...climbing over green lands
and above the hills.

00:28:19.878 --> 00:28:22.333
I stood upon the brink.

00:28:23.256 --> 00:28:26.423
It was utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet.

00:28:28.344 --> 00:28:31.131
A light shone behind me...

00:28:31.764 --> 00:28:34.172
...but I could not turn.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.766
I could only stand there, waiting.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.935
Night changes many thoughts.

00:28:42.317 --> 00:28:44.475
Sleep, Éowyn.

00:28:45.028 --> 00:28:47.269
Sleep...

00:28:49.991 --> 00:28:51.865
...while you can.

00:29:16.017 --> 00:29:18.306
The stars are veiled.

00:29:19.312 --> 00:29:22.811
Something stirs in the east.

00:29:23.483 --> 00:29:26.602
A sleepless malice.

00:29:28.613 --> 00:29:31.400
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

00:29:44.837 --> 00:29:47.542
What are you doing?

00:29:52.178 --> 00:29:53.637
Pippin!

00:30:01.145 --> 00:30:02.889
Pippin?

00:30:15.785 --> 00:30:17.113
Pippin.

00:30:17.787 --> 00:30:20.456
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

00:30:20.623 --> 00:30:21.738
Just one more time.

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:24.075
Put it back.

00:30:34.345 --> 00:30:36.136
Pippin.

00:30:42.645 --> 00:30:44.139
No!

00:30:49.235 --> 00:30:50.480
Pippin.

00:30:53.823 --> 00:30:55.021
He is here.

00:30:55.199 --> 00:30:57.488
I see you.

00:31:00.496 --> 00:31:02.121
Pippin!

00:31:16.762 --> 00:31:19.514
Help! Gandalf, help!

00:31:21.267 --> 00:31:23.141
Someone help him!

00:31:29.525 --> 00:31:30.723
Pippin!

00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:33.106
Fool of a Took!

00:31:54.216 --> 00:31:56.423
Look at me.

00:31:58.387 --> 00:32:02.515
Gandalf, forgive me.

00:32:02.683 --> 00:32:04.557
Look at me.

00:32:04.727 --> 00:32:06.554
What did you see?

00:32:10.066 --> 00:32:12.142
A tree.

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.984
There was a white tree...

00:32:15.154 --> 00:32:16.648
...in a courtyard of stone.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.730
It was dead.

00:32:24.914 --> 00:32:26.741
The city was burning.

00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:30.285
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

00:32:30.961 --> 00:32:33.001
I saw...

00:32:36.384 --> 00:32:37.759
I saw him.

00:32:40.763 --> 00:32:43.005
I could hear his voice in my head.

00:32:43.182 --> 00:32:45.590
And what did you tell him?

00:32:45.768 --> 00:32:47.595
Speak!

00:32:51.774 --> 00:32:54.941
He asked me my name.
I didn't answer.

00:32:55.111 --> 00:32:56.569
He hurt me.

00:32:56.737 --> 00:32:59.193
What did you tell him
about Frodo and the Ring?

00:33:02.701 --> 00:33:05.157
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

00:33:05.996 --> 00:33:08.238
A fool...

00:33:08.415 --> 00:33:10.704
...but an honest fool he remains.

00:33:11.168 --> 00:33:14.703
He told Sauron nothing
of Frodo and the Ring.

00:33:15.756 --> 00:33:18.128
We've been strangely fortunate.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.168
Pippin saw in the palantir
a glimpse of the enemy's plan.

00:33:23.097 --> 00:33:27.047
Sauron moves to strike
the city of Minas Tirith.

00:33:27.643 --> 00:33:31.392
His defeat at Helm's Deep
showed our enemy one thing.

00:33:31.564 --> 00:33:33.889
He knows the heir of Elendil
has come forth.

00:33:34.066 --> 00:33:36.189
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.144
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

00:33:40.364 --> 00:33:42.238
Sauron fears this.

00:33:42.408 --> 00:33:46.737
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

00:33:47.913 --> 00:33:50.321
He will raze Minas Tirith
to the ground...

00:33:50.499 --> 00:33:53.998
...before he sees a king
return to the throne of Men.

00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:58.084
If the beacons of Gondor are lit,
Rohan must be ready for war.

00:33:59.008 --> 00:34:01.214
Tell me...

00:34:01.385 --> 00:34:05.169
...why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:10.886
What do we owe Gondor?

00:34:12.021 --> 00:34:14.060
- I will go.
- No!

00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:17.398
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

00:34:20.821 --> 00:34:23.359
You must come to Minas Tirith
by another road.

00:34:23.907 --> 00:34:28.368
Follow the river.
Look to the black ships.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.287
Understand this:

00:34:31.457 --> 00:34:35.122
Things are now in motion
that cannot be undone.

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:38.705
I ride for Minas Tirith...

00:34:40.966 --> 00:34:43.635
...and I won't be going alone.

00:34:45.387 --> 00:34:49.052
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

00:34:50.059 --> 00:34:51.719
Hurry! Hurry!

00:34:53.228 --> 00:34:54.639
Where are we going?

00:34:54.813 --> 00:34:56.058
Why did you look?

00:34:56.231 --> 00:34:58.983
Why do you always have to look?

00:34:59.151 --> 00:35:02.235
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

00:35:02.696 --> 00:35:04.107
I'm sorry, all right?

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.117
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:11.827
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

00:35:11.997 --> 00:35:15.746
He's going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here.

00:35:17.169 --> 00:35:19.838
And you-- ? You're coming with me?

00:35:22.049 --> 00:35:23.460
Merry?

00:35:23.634 --> 00:35:24.914
Come on.

00:35:30.432 --> 00:35:31.808
How far is Minas Tirith?

00:35:31.975 --> 00:35:34.597
Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:38.269
And you better hope we don't have
one of those on our tail.

00:35:38.982 --> 00:35:40.477
Here.

00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:42.442
Something for the road.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.277
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

00:35:45.447 --> 00:35:49.445
I know you've run out.
You smoke too much, Pippin.

00:35:49.618 --> 00:35:52.109
But-- But we'll see each other soon.

00:35:55.457 --> 00:35:57.948
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

00:35:59.962 --> 00:36:02.001
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:36:02.172 --> 00:36:03.880
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

00:36:04.049 --> 00:36:05.508
Show us the meaning of haste.

00:36:05.676 --> 00:36:07.585
Merry!

00:36:18.063 --> 00:36:19.178
Merry!

00:36:29.658 --> 00:36:31.152
He's always followed me...

00:36:31.827 --> 00:36:33.866
...everywhere I went...

00:36:34.204 --> 00:36:35.996
...since before we were tweens.

00:36:37.165 --> 00:36:41.080
I would get him into
the worst sort of trouble...

00:36:41.253 --> 00:36:43.329
...but I was always there to get him out.

00:36:45.799 --> 00:36:47.673
Now he's gone.

00:36:49.344 --> 00:36:52.262
Just like Frodo and Sam.

00:36:52.889 --> 00:36:55.641
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

00:36:55.809 --> 00:36:57.469
They're a most hardy folk.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.720
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

00:37:16.204 --> 00:37:18.493
Take her by the safest road.

00:37:18.665 --> 00:37:21.156
A ship lies anchored
in the Grey Havens.

00:37:21.335 --> 00:37:25.202
It waits to carry her across the sea.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.749
The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.

00:38:34.366 --> 00:38:37.450
There is nothing for you here...

00:38:37.953 --> 00:38:40.159
...only death.

00:38:47.462 --> 00:38:48.743
Lady Arwen...

00:38:49.673 --> 00:38:51.582
...we cannot delay.

00:38:54.052 --> 00:38:55.297
My lady!

00:39:14.698 --> 00:39:17.319
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

00:39:17.492 --> 00:39:19.449
You have the gift of foresight.

00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:21.411
What did you see?

00:39:22.038 --> 00:39:25.372
I looked into your future,
and I saw death.

00:39:25.917 --> 00:39:28.040
But there is also life.

00:39:29.963 --> 00:39:34.008
You saw there was a child.
You saw my son.

00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:37.172
That future is almost gone.

00:39:37.345 --> 00:39:39.338
But it is not lost.

00:39:41.933 --> 00:39:44.140
Nothing is certain.

00:39:45.854 --> 00:39:48.559
Some things are certain.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.195
If I leave him now...

00:39:55.363 --> 00:39:57.985
... I will regret it forever.

00:39:59.075 --> 00:40:01.401
It is time.

00:40:06.666 --> 00:40:10.450
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

00:40:10.628 --> 00:40:14.044
A light from the shadow shall spring

00:40:14.215 --> 00:40:17.501
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

00:40:24.893 --> 00:40:28.096
The crownless again shall be king

00:40:31.858 --> 00:40:33.898
Re-forge the sword.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.475
Your hands are cold.

00:41:14.859 --> 00:41:17.979
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

00:41:21.407 --> 00:41:23.317
This was my choice.

00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:27.450
Whether by your will or not...

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:33.084
...there is no ship now
that can bear me hence.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.135
We've just passed
into the realm of Gondor.

00:42:34.772 --> 00:42:37.014
Minas Tirith.

00:42:37.608 --> 00:42:39.934
City of kings.

00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:13.100
Make way!

00:43:42.298 --> 00:43:44.125
It's the tree.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.960
Gandalf. Gandalf.

00:43:46.135 --> 00:43:48.377
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

00:43:48.554 --> 00:43:50.381
The tree of the king.

00:43:50.556 --> 00:43:53.226
Lord Denethor, however,
is not king.

00:43:53.392 --> 00:43:56.062
He is a steward only,
a caretaker of the throne.

00:43:56.813 --> 00:44:00.347
Now listen carefully.
Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.684
To give him news of his beloved son's
death would be most unwise.

00:44:05.154 --> 00:44:08.606
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

00:44:09.492 --> 00:44:12.244
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.947
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

00:44:48.114 --> 00:44:54.615
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:04.835
I come with tidings in this dark hour,
and with counsel.

00:45:05.798 --> 00:45:09.167
Perhaps you come to explain this.

00:45:14.807 --> 00:45:19.350
Perhaps you come to tell me
why my son is dead.

00:45:33.826 --> 00:45:36.827
Boromir died to save us...

00:45:36.996 --> 00:45:38.656
...my kinsman and me.

00:45:38.831 --> 00:45:42.330
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.291
I offer you my service, such as it is...

00:45:51.844 --> 00:45:53.837
...in payment of this debt.

00:45:56.015 --> 00:45:59.348
This is my first command to you.

00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:03.512
How did you escape
and my son did not...

00:46:03.856 --> 00:46:06.181
...so mighty a man as he was?

00:46:06.859 --> 00:46:10.193
The mightiest man
may be slain by one arrow...

00:46:10.446 --> 00:46:12.355
...and Boromir was pierced by many.

00:46:16.494 --> 00:46:18.202
Get up.

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:22.997
My lord, there will be a time
to grieve for Boromir...

00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:25.202
...but it is not now.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.126
War is coming.

00:46:28.464 --> 00:46:32.877
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

00:46:33.052 --> 00:46:37.215
...with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

00:46:37.389 --> 00:46:42.265
You still have friends.
You are not alone in this fight.

00:46:42.436 --> 00:46:46.932
Send word to Théoden of Rohan.
Light the beacons.

00:46:48.526 --> 00:46:52.060
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

00:46:52.238 --> 00:46:55.274
Yet for all your subtleties,
you have not wisdom.

00:46:57.409 --> 00:47:01.573
Do you think the eyes
of the White Tower are blind?

00:47:01.747 --> 00:47:04.831
I have seen more than you know.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.204
With your left hand you would use me
as a shield against Mordor.

00:47:08.379 --> 00:47:11.249
And with your right
you'd seek to supplant me.

00:47:11.423 --> 00:47:15.124
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.

00:47:15.302 --> 00:47:21.257
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

00:47:21.433 --> 00:47:26.261
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

00:47:26.438 --> 00:47:30.935
...last of a ragged house
long bereft of lordship.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:36.946
Authority is not given to you
to deny the return of the king, steward.

00:47:37.116 --> 00:47:41.528
The rule of Gondor is mine
and no other's.

00:47:46.709 --> 00:47:48.500
Come.

00:47:56.427 --> 00:47:59.000
All has turned to vain ambition.

00:47:59.179 --> 00:48:02.631
He would even use his grief
as a cloak.

00:48:05.519 --> 00:48:08.306
A thousand years
this city has stood.

00:48:09.398 --> 00:48:11.806
Now, at the whim of a madman,
it will fall.

00:48:13.027 --> 00:48:15.233
And the White Tree,
the tree of the king...

00:48:15.404 --> 00:48:16.946
...will never bloom again.

00:48:17.114 --> 00:48:20.483
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

00:48:20.659 --> 00:48:23.826
A faint and fading hope
that one day it will flower.

00:48:23.996 --> 00:48:28.741
That a king will come
and this city will be as it once was...

00:48:28.917 --> 00:48:31.835
...before it fell into decay.

00:48:32.004 --> 00:48:35.254
The old wisdom borne out
of the West was forsaken.

00:48:35.424 --> 00:48:39.718
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

00:48:39.928 --> 00:48:41.838
...and counted the old names
of their descent...

00:48:42.014 --> 00:48:44.801
...dearer than the names of their sons.

00:48:44.975 --> 00:48:50.017
Childless lords sat in aged halls,
musing on heraldry...

00:48:50.189 --> 00:48:55.527
...or in high, cold towers,
asking questions of the stars.

00:48:55.694 --> 00:48:59.478
And so the people of Gondor
fell into ruin.

00:49:00.449 --> 00:49:02.774
The line of kings failed.

00:49:03.494 --> 00:49:05.866
The White Tree withered.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:10.744
The rule of Gondor was given over
to lesser men.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:22.715
Mordor.

00:49:23.222 --> 00:49:26.887
Yes, there it lies.

00:49:27.726 --> 00:49:31.060
This city has dwelt ever
in the sight of its shadow.

00:49:33.065 --> 00:49:34.725
A storm is coming.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.318
This is not the weather of the world.

00:49:38.487 --> 00:49:40.693
This is a device of Sauron's making.

00:49:40.864 --> 00:49:44.613
A broil of fume
he sends ahead of his host.

00:49:45.202 --> 00:49:47.657
The Orcs of Mordor
have no love of daylight...

00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:49.656
...so he covers the face of the sun...

00:49:49.831 --> 00:49:53.580
...to ease their passage
along the road to war.

00:49:53.752 --> 00:49:57.038
When the Shadow of Mordor
reaches this city...

00:49:57.756 --> 00:49:59.464
...it will begin.

00:50:01.134 --> 00:50:02.712
Well...

00:50:03.095 --> 00:50:04.423
... Minas Tirith...

00:50:06.348 --> 00:50:07.759
...very impressive.

00:50:07.933 --> 00:50:10.554
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

00:50:10.727 --> 00:50:12.934
There's no leaving this city.

00:50:15.274 --> 00:50:18.477
Help must come to us.

00:50:19.987 --> 00:50:22.656
It must be getting near teatime.

00:50:22.823 --> 00:50:26.523
Leastways, it would be in decent places
where there is still teatime.

00:50:26.702 --> 00:50:30.284
We're not in decent places.

00:50:35.836 --> 00:50:37.081
Mr. Frodo?

00:50:40.132 --> 00:50:41.330
What is it?

00:50:43.802 --> 00:50:46.174
It's just a feeling.

00:50:48.598 --> 00:50:50.757
I don't think I'll be coming back.

00:50:55.272 --> 00:50:57.810
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

00:50:58.442 --> 00:51:00.315
That's just morbid thinking.

00:51:00.777 --> 00:51:03.233
We're going there and back again...

00:51:03.405 --> 00:51:05.694
...just like Mr. Bilbo.

00:51:06.658 --> 00:51:08.781
You'll see.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.578
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

00:51:24.968 --> 00:51:29.013
Long ago, when there was a king.

00:51:49.659 --> 00:51:52.495
Mr. Frodo, look.

00:51:54.122 --> 00:51:56.874
The king has got a crown again.

00:52:08.011 --> 00:52:12.258
Come on, Hobbits!
Mustn't stop now. This way.

00:52:29.115 --> 00:52:33.160
So I imagine this is just
a ceremonial position.

00:52:33.328 --> 00:52:37.575
I mean, they don't actually expect me
to do any fighting.

00:52:38.416 --> 00:52:41.666
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

00:52:41.836 --> 00:52:45.205
You'll have to do as you're told,
Peregrin Took.

00:52:49.261 --> 00:52:51.752
Ridiculous Hobbit.

00:52:52.931 --> 00:52:55.137
Guard of the Citadel.

00:53:04.651 --> 00:53:06.478
Thank you.

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:18.112
There's no more stars.

00:53:18.623 --> 00:53:19.821
Is it time?

00:53:21.001 --> 00:53:22.744
Yes.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.040
It's so quiet.

00:53:28.049 --> 00:53:32.296
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

00:53:33.471 --> 00:53:36.342
I don't want to be in a battle...

00:53:37.183 --> 00:53:42.141
...but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

00:53:45.692 --> 00:53:49.310
Is there any hope, Gandalf,
for Frodo and Sam?

00:53:50.655 --> 00:53:53.775
There never was much hope.

00:53:55.744 --> 00:53:57.487
Just a fool's hope.

00:54:03.376 --> 00:54:06.163
Our enemy is ready.

00:54:06.337 --> 00:54:09.007
His full strength's gathered.

00:54:09.174 --> 00:54:12.673
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

00:54:12.844 --> 00:54:15.880
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

00:54:16.055 --> 00:54:18.760
...mercenaries from the coast.

00:54:18.933 --> 00:54:21.507
All will answer Mordor's call.

00:54:21.686 --> 00:54:23.228
Come on.

00:54:24.355 --> 00:54:27.689
This will be the end of Gondor
as we know it.

00:54:27.859 --> 00:54:31.228
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

00:54:32.197 --> 00:54:36.526
If the river is taken,
if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...

00:54:36.701 --> 00:54:40.366
...the last defense of this city
will be gone.

00:54:40.538 --> 00:54:44.583
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

00:54:50.465 --> 00:54:52.042
Gandalf?

00:54:55.762 --> 00:54:59.427
Sauron has yet to reveal
his deadliest servant...

00:54:59.891 --> 00:55:03.723
...the one who will lead
Mordor's armies in war.

00:55:03.895 --> 00:55:09.055
The one they say no living man can kill.

00:55:10.068 --> 00:55:12.226
The Witch King of Angmar.

00:55:13.321 --> 00:55:15.693
You've met him before.

00:55:16.366 --> 00:55:18.939
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:28.205
He is the lord of the Nazgûl...

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:31.125
...the greatest of the Nine.

00:55:31.297 --> 00:55:34.915
Minas Morgul is his lair.

00:55:38.388 --> 00:55:41.922
The Dead City.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:47.307
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

00:55:54.529 --> 00:55:56.687
Quick. Quick.

00:55:56.864 --> 00:56:00.862
They will see. They will see.

00:56:10.128 --> 00:56:15.418
Come away. Come away.
Look, we have found it.

00:56:15.591 --> 00:56:19.459
The way into Mordor.

00:56:19.637 --> 00:56:23.966
The secret stair.

00:56:24.392 --> 00:56:26.764
Climb.

00:56:47.039 --> 00:56:49.791
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:57.501
- What's it doing?
- No.

00:56:57.675 --> 00:57:00.759
- They're calling me.
- No.

00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:33.370
Hide! Hide!

00:58:16.921 --> 00:58:19.756
I can feel his blade.

00:58:31.435 --> 00:58:33.558
We come to it at last.

00:58:35.398 --> 00:58:38.268
The great battle of our time.

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.690
Come away, Hobbits.
We climb. We must climb.

00:59:30.578 --> 00:59:33.579
The board is set.

00:59:33.748 --> 00:59:36.285
The pieces are moving.

00:59:38.836 --> 00:59:41.505
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

00:59:41.672 --> 00:59:44.341
And then it's into the tunnel.

00:59:44.508 --> 00:59:47.711
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

00:59:48.262 --> 00:59:51.014
You listen to me,
and you listen good and proper.

00:59:51.182 --> 00:59:54.099
Anything happens to him,
you have me to answer to.

00:59:54.268 --> 00:59:55.846
One sniff something's not right...

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.186
...one hair stands up
on the back of my head, it's over.

00:59:59.398 --> 01:00:02.067
No more slinker. No more stinker.

01:00:02.401 --> 01:00:05.022
You're gone. Got it?

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:07.897
I'm watching you.

01:00:13.245 --> 01:00:15.238
What was that about?

01:00:15.414 --> 01:00:17.822
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

01:00:24.465 --> 01:00:27.335
Peregrin Took, my lad,
there is a task now to be done.

01:00:27.509 --> 01:00:32.088
Another opportunity for one
of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

01:00:36.936 --> 01:00:38.513
You must not fail me.

01:01:12.763 --> 01:01:15.847
It's been very quiet across the river.

01:01:16.016 --> 01:01:18.341
The Orcs are lying low.

01:01:18.519 --> 01:01:20.511
The garrison may have moved out.

01:01:21.647 --> 01:01:24.352
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

01:01:24.525 --> 01:01:27.810
If the Orcs attack from the north,
we'll have some warning.

01:01:53.137 --> 01:01:54.335
Quiet.

01:01:58.434 --> 01:02:00.391
We need 10 more.

01:02:21.707 --> 01:02:23.249
Kill him!

01:02:40.559 --> 01:02:42.967
They're not coming from the north.

01:02:44.396 --> 01:02:48.725
To the river. Quick. Quick.
Go. Come on.

01:02:52.196 --> 01:02:53.773
Faster.

01:03:06.919 --> 01:03:09.291
Draw swords.

01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.424
Hold! Hold them!

01:05:26.725 --> 01:05:28.599
What?

01:05:41.156 --> 01:05:42.567
Amon Dîn.

01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:51.408
The beacon.
The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.

01:05:54.669 --> 01:05:58.881
Hope is kindled.

01:07:31.266 --> 01:07:35.643
The beacons of Minas Tirith!
The beacons are lit!

01:07:36.855 --> 01:07:38.479
Gondor calls for aid.

01:07:48.992 --> 01:07:51.909
And Rohan will answer.

01:07:52.328 --> 01:07:55.116
Muster the Rohirrim.

01:08:10.221 --> 01:08:12.178
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

01:08:12.348 --> 01:08:16.726
As many men as can be found.
You have two days.

01:08:16.895 --> 01:08:22.185
On the third,
we ride for Gondor and war.

01:08:23.151 --> 01:08:24.479
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

01:08:24.652 --> 01:08:25.981
- Gamling.
- My lord.

01:08:26.154 --> 01:08:27.731
Make haste
across the Riddermark.

01:08:27.906 --> 01:08:30.029
Summon every able-bodied man
to Dunharrow.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.777
I will.

01:08:35.872 --> 01:08:39.039
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

01:08:39.209 --> 01:08:43.123
It's tradition for the women
of the court to farewell the men.

01:08:49.677 --> 01:08:51.586
The men have found their captain.

01:08:51.763 --> 01:08:55.096
They will follow you into battle,
even to death.

01:08:55.266 --> 01:08:56.844
You have given us hope.

01:09:00.063 --> 01:09:02.020
Excuse me.

01:09:03.358 --> 01:09:04.852
I have a sword.

01:09:05.151 --> 01:09:06.526
Please accept it.

01:09:07.654 --> 01:09:12.150
I offer you my service, Théoden King.

01:09:15.578 --> 01:09:17.654
And gladly I accept it.

01:09:18.748 --> 01:09:22.828
You shall be Meriadoc,
esquire of Rohan.

01:09:27.715 --> 01:09:28.913
Horse-Men.

01:09:29.592 --> 01:09:35.215
I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,
fully armed and filthy.

01:09:35.598 --> 01:09:38.552
Your kinsmen may have no need
to ride to war.

01:09:38.726 --> 01:09:42.142
I fear war already marches
on their own lands.

01:10:00.623 --> 01:10:04.074
So it is before the walls
of Minas Tirith...

01:10:04.252 --> 01:10:08.119
...the doom of our time will be decided.

01:10:10.716 --> 01:10:16.256
Now is the hour.
Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

01:10:16.431 --> 01:10:19.965
Now, fulfill them all.
To lord and land!

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.018
Faramir!

01:11:11.319 --> 01:11:15.019
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

01:11:15.615 --> 01:11:18.699
Tell the men to break cover.
We ride for Minas Tirith.

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.702
Nazgûl.

01:11:32.089 --> 01:11:34.545
Take cover!

01:11:34.717 --> 01:11:37.255
Nazgûl!

01:11:37.428 --> 01:11:41.093
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

01:11:47.688 --> 01:11:49.562
Fall back!

01:11:56.614 --> 01:12:01.192
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

01:12:25.434 --> 01:12:29.764
The age of Men is over.

01:12:29.939 --> 01:12:35.562
The time of the Orc has come.

01:12:37.947 --> 01:12:40.272
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgûl.

01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:44.281
Take cover, my lord!

01:12:44.578 --> 01:12:45.907
It's coming!

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:54.829
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

01:13:34.795 --> 01:13:36.170
Pull!

01:13:53.898 --> 01:13:56.305
Mithrandir.

01:13:56.483 --> 01:13:58.227
They broke through our defenses.

01:13:58.402 --> 01:14:00.608
They've taken the bridge
and the west bank.

01:14:01.697 --> 01:14:05.861
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

01:14:06.035 --> 01:14:10.578
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

01:14:13.959 --> 01:14:16.367
Faramir?

01:14:18.297 --> 01:14:22.129
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:24.507
No.

01:14:25.846 --> 01:14:27.388
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

01:14:28.265 --> 01:14:31.681
- Where? When?
- In lthilien.

01:14:31.852 --> 01:14:33.928
Not two days ago.

01:14:34.396 --> 01:14:38.857
Gandalf, they're taking the road
to the Morgul Vale.

01:14:39.568 --> 01:14:42.189
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

01:14:44.406 --> 01:14:46.778
What does that mean?

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:51.862
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

01:14:52.039 --> 01:14:54.078
Tell me all you know.

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:58.666
This is how you would serve your city?

01:14:58.837 --> 01:15:02.123
You would risk its utter ruin?

01:15:03.175 --> 01:15:04.753
I did what I judged to be right.

01:15:05.469 --> 01:15:08.470
What you judged to be right.

01:15:09.098 --> 01:15:14.970
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:23.768
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

01:15:25.406 --> 01:15:26.948
Hidden.

01:15:27.366 --> 01:15:30.118
Dark and deep in the vaults...

01:15:30.285 --> 01:15:32.444
...not to be used.

01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:41.501
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

01:15:41.964 --> 01:15:44.003
I would not use the Ring.

01:15:44.174 --> 01:15:47.259
Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin
and I alone could save her.

01:15:47.594 --> 01:15:52.422
Ever you desire to appear lordly
and gracious...

01:15:52.599 --> 01:15:54.841
...as a king of old.

01:15:56.645 --> 01:16:00.394
Boromir would have remembered
his father's need.

01:16:00.816 --> 01:16:03.271
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

01:16:03.485 --> 01:16:06.023
Boromir would not
have brought the Ring.

01:16:06.446 --> 01:16:09.566
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

01:16:09.741 --> 01:16:11.983
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

01:16:13.871 --> 01:16:16.029
And when he returned...

01:16:17.166 --> 01:16:18.826
...you would not have known your son.

01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:21.539
Boromir was loyal to me!

01:16:21.712 --> 01:16:24.285
Not some wizard's pupil!

01:16:32.431 --> 01:16:33.759
Father?

01:16:46.445 --> 01:16:48.354
My son.

01:17:14.598 --> 01:17:15.973
Leave me.

01:17:49.549 --> 01:17:52.087
Careful, master. Careful.

01:17:52.427 --> 01:17:55.345
Very far to fall.

01:17:57.849 --> 01:18:01.764
Very dangerous are the stairs.

01:18:04.439 --> 01:18:06.977
Come, master.

01:18:12.781 --> 01:18:15.948
Come to Sméagol.

01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:23.785
Mr. Frodo.

01:18:24.793 --> 01:18:26.335
Get back, you!

01:18:26.503 --> 01:18:28.709
Don't touch him!

01:18:32.843 --> 01:18:35.678
Why does he hates poor Sméagol?

01:18:35.846 --> 01:18:39.546
What has Sméagol ever done to him?

01:18:39.724 --> 01:18:42.097
Master?

01:18:42.894 --> 01:18:46.346
Master carries heavy burden.

01:18:46.523 --> 01:18:51.944
Sméagol knows.
Heavy, heavy burden.

01:18:52.112 --> 01:18:55.362
Fat one cannot know.

01:18:57.409 --> 01:19:00.160
Sméagol look after master.

01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:03.577
He wants it.

01:19:03.748 --> 01:19:08.291
He needs it.
Sméagol sees it in his eye.

01:19:08.461 --> 01:19:13.918
Very soon he will ask you for it.
You will see.

01:19:14.092 --> 01:19:17.959
The fat one will take it from you.

01:19:25.186 --> 01:19:29.516
Send forth all legions.

01:19:29.691 --> 01:19:33.736
Do not stop the attack
until the city is taken.

01:19:34.446 --> 01:19:37.565
Slay them all.

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:45.031
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

01:19:48.376 --> 01:19:50.784
Where are Théoden's riders?

01:19:50.962 --> 01:19:53.536
Will Rohan's army come?

01:19:53.715 --> 01:19:55.957
Mithrandir.

01:19:57.010 --> 01:20:00.877
Courage is the best defense
that you have now.

01:20:05.685 --> 01:20:08.390
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

01:20:10.482 --> 01:20:16.187
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

01:20:16.363 --> 01:20:17.857
It was well done.

01:20:21.034 --> 01:20:25.079
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:28.368
You are to join the tower guard.

01:20:28.917 --> 01:20:31.918
I didn't think they would find any livery
that would fit me.

01:20:32.087 --> 01:20:34.542
Once belonged to a young boy
of the city.

01:20:34.714 --> 01:20:36.256
A very foolish one...

01:20:36.424 --> 01:20:40.671
...who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

01:20:40.845 --> 01:20:43.597
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

01:20:43.765 --> 01:20:45.556
My father had it made for me.

01:20:46.601 --> 01:20:47.929
Well...

01:20:48.103 --> 01:20:50.095
... I'm taller than you were then.

01:20:50.271 --> 01:20:53.605
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore,
except sideways.

01:20:56.569 --> 01:20:58.609
Never fitted me either.

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:01.615
Boromir was always the soldier.

01:21:04.619 --> 01:21:07.027
They were so alike, he and my father.

01:21:09.124 --> 01:21:10.748
Proud.

01:21:10.917 --> 01:21:12.115
Stubborn even.

01:21:13.878 --> 01:21:15.372
But strong.

01:21:16.881 --> 01:21:20.048
I think you have strength
of a different kind.

01:21:20.677 --> 01:21:23.132
And one day your father will see it.

01:21:27.308 --> 01:21:31.092
Here do I swear fealty
and service to Gondor...

01:21:31.271 --> 01:21:32.765
...in peace or war...

01:21:33.398 --> 01:21:35.853
...in living or dying...

01:21:37.235 --> 01:21:38.480
...from...

01:21:41.155 --> 01:21:43.943
From this hour henceforth...

01:21:44.117 --> 01:21:46.026
...until my lord release me...

01:21:47.537 --> 01:21:49.743
...or death take me.

01:21:50.331 --> 01:21:52.822
And I shall not forget it...

01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:56.370
...nor fail to reward
that which is given.

01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:06.259
Fealty with love.

01:22:07.348 --> 01:22:09.008
Valour with honour.

01:22:10.602 --> 01:22:13.935
Disloyalty with vengeance.

01:22:22.572 --> 01:22:26.652
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

01:22:26.826 --> 01:22:29.578
...defenses that your brother
long held intact.

01:22:29.746 --> 01:22:32.237
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:35.202
...the river in Pelennor unfought.

01:22:35.376 --> 01:22:37.036
Osgiliath must be retaken.

01:22:37.211 --> 01:22:39.251
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:42.710
Much must be risked in war.

01:22:45.345 --> 01:22:49.294
Is there a captain here who still has
the courage to do his lord's will?

01:22:55.521 --> 01:22:58.771
You wish now that our places
had been exchanged...

01:22:59.734 --> 01:23:02.569
...that I had died
and Boromir had lived.

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:07.734
Yes.

01:23:08.409 --> 01:23:10.616
I wish that.

01:23:19.003 --> 01:23:21.494
Since you were robbed
of Boromir...

01:23:23.341 --> 01:23:26.258
... I will do what I can
in his stead.

01:23:34.435 --> 01:23:38.896
If I should return,
think better of me, Father.

01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:44.602
That will depend on the manner
of your return.

01:25:07.903 --> 01:25:10.229
What are you up to?

01:25:10.406 --> 01:25:11.651
Sneaking off, are we?

01:25:12.366 --> 01:25:14.193
Sneaking?

01:25:15.202 --> 01:25:17.361
Sneaking?

01:25:18.789 --> 01:25:21.956
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

01:25:22.126 --> 01:25:27.203
Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

01:25:27.381 --> 01:25:29.540
...and they say "sneak."

01:25:30.176 --> 01:25:32.749
Sneak?

01:25:33.387 --> 01:25:36.092
Very nice friend.
Oh, yes, my precious.

01:25:36.265 --> 01:25:38.886
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

01:25:40.144 --> 01:25:42.350
You just startled me is all.

01:25:42.855 --> 01:25:44.682
What were you doing?

01:25:46.317 --> 01:25:48.440
Sneaking.

01:25:48.819 --> 01:25:51.904
Fine. Have it your own way.

01:25:54.158 --> 01:25:56.649
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

01:25:57.036 --> 01:25:58.993
We have to be moving on.

01:26:04.168 --> 01:26:05.746
It's dark still.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.126
It's always dark here.

01:26:12.384 --> 01:26:14.294
It's gone!

01:26:15.513 --> 01:26:18.383
- The Elven bread.
- What?

01:26:18.557 --> 01:26:20.016
That's all we have left.

01:26:24.105 --> 01:26:26.596
He took it. He must have!

01:26:27.108 --> 01:26:30.358
Sméagol?
No, no, not poor Sméagol.

01:26:30.528 --> 01:26:33.445
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.

01:26:33.614 --> 01:26:36.781
You're a lying rat!
What did you do with it?!

01:26:36.951 --> 01:26:38.493
He doesn't eat it.

01:26:39.495 --> 01:26:41.820
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

01:26:42.873 --> 01:26:44.700
What's this?

01:26:47.378 --> 01:26:50.711
Crumbs on his jacketses.
He took it!

01:26:51.423 --> 01:26:53.083
He took it.

01:26:53.926 --> 01:26:58.137
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

01:26:58.305 --> 01:27:00.097
That's a filthy lie!

01:27:00.266 --> 01:27:02.472
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

01:27:02.643 --> 01:27:03.888
- Sam!
- Call me--

01:27:04.061 --> 01:27:05.306
Stop it!

01:27:06.313 --> 01:27:07.511
Sam!

01:27:08.816 --> 01:27:12.434
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

01:27:13.487 --> 01:27:19.027
Oh, my-- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so-- So angry.

01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:21.324
Here, just--
Let's just rest a bit.

01:27:21.495 --> 01:27:23.571
- I'm all right.
- No.

01:27:23.747 --> 01:27:26.832
No, you're not all right.
You're exhausted.

01:27:27.001 --> 01:27:29.124
It's that Gollum.

01:27:29.295 --> 01:27:31.003
It's this place.

01:27:31.171 --> 01:27:33.745
It's that thing around your neck.

01:27:37.261 --> 01:27:38.541
I could help a bit.

01:27:38.721 --> 01:27:41.390
I could carry it for a while.

01:27:41.557 --> 01:27:43.300
Carry it for a while.

01:27:43.475 --> 01:27:44.720
I could carry it... I could carry it.

01:27:45.352 --> 01:27:50.809
Share the load...Share the load...
the load...the load.

01:27:50.983 --> 01:27:52.181
Get away!

01:27:52.359 --> 01:27:53.937
I don't want to keep it.

01:27:57.531 --> 01:27:59.524
I just want to help.

01:28:01.577 --> 01:28:04.198
See? See?

01:28:04.371 --> 01:28:07.787
He wants it for himself.

01:28:07.958 --> 01:28:09.666
Shut up, you!

01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:12.037
Go away!
Get out of here!

01:28:12.212 --> 01:28:14.039
No, Sam.

01:28:14.214 --> 01:28:15.459
It's you.

01:28:19.678 --> 01:28:21.386
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:28:23.057 --> 01:28:24.432
But he's a liar.

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.269
He's poisoned you against me.

01:28:28.687 --> 01:28:30.596
You can't help me anymore.

01:28:32.566 --> 01:28:34.440
You don't mean that.

01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:38.737
Go home.

01:29:58.777 --> 01:30:00.568
Faramir!

01:30:00.737 --> 01:30:02.647
Faramir!

01:30:04.157 --> 01:30:06.197
Your father's will has turned
to madness.

01:30:07.369 --> 01:30:09.409
Do not throw away your life
so rashly.

01:30:10.163 --> 01:30:12.489
Where does my allegiance lie
if not here?

01:30:13.125 --> 01:30:16.042
This is the city of the Men of Nûmenor.

01:30:16.670 --> 01:30:19.457
I will gladly give my life
to defend her beauty...

01:30:19.631 --> 01:30:22.834
...her memory, her wisdom.

01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:28.636
Your father loves you, Faramir.

01:30:29.349 --> 01:30:32.350
He will remember it
before the end.

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:43.506
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

01:31:46.384 --> 01:31:47.879
Well...

01:31:48.428 --> 01:31:50.053
...yes.

01:31:50.764 --> 01:31:54.512
At least, well enough
for my own people.

01:31:56.144 --> 01:31:58.552
But we have no songs
for great halls...

01:31:59.606 --> 01:32:00.851
...and evil times.

01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:04.858
And why should your songs
be unfit for my halls?

01:32:07.656 --> 01:32:09.066
Come, sing me a song.

01:32:20.126 --> 01:32:23.460
# Home is behind

01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:27.378
# The world ahead

01:32:29.803 --> 01:32:35.639
# And there are many paths to tread

01:32:37.435 --> 01:32:40.970
# Through shadow

01:32:41.147 --> 01:32:45.311
# To the edge of night

01:32:46.987 --> 01:32:52.064
# Until the stars are all alight

01:32:55.078 --> 01:32:59.407
# Mist and shadow

01:32:59.583 --> 01:33:03.876
# Cloud and shade

01:33:06.256 --> 01:33:09.589
# All shall fade

01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:15.968
# All shall

01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:24.102
# Fade

01:33:48.506 --> 01:33:51.958
March! March!

01:33:52.135 --> 01:33:57.342
March! March! March!

01:34:00.810 --> 01:34:03.136
Make way for the king.

01:34:04.647 --> 01:34:06.640
Make way.

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:11.150
The king is here.

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:14.739
My lord.

01:34:15.992 --> 01:34:17.949
Hail to you, sire.

01:34:18.411 --> 01:34:19.609
Grimbold, how many?

01:34:19.788 --> 01:34:22.243
I bring 500 men from the Westfold,
my lord.

01:34:23.208 --> 01:34:25.877
We have 300 more from Fenmarch,
Théoden King.

01:34:27.003 --> 01:34:30.953
- Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
- None have come, my lord.

01:34:48.024 --> 01:34:50.147
Six thousand spears.

01:34:51.194 --> 01:34:53.187
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

01:34:53.488 --> 01:34:56.857
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

01:34:59.619 --> 01:35:01.362
More will come.

01:35:01.746 --> 01:35:04.700
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

01:35:04.874 --> 01:35:07.448
We have till dawn,
then we must ride.

01:35:26.938 --> 01:35:29.263
The horses are restless...

01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.935
...and the men are quiet.

01:35:31.401 --> 01:35:34.520
They grow nervous in the shadow
of the mountain.

01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:38.863
That road there...

01:35:39.784 --> 01:35:41.860
...where does that lead?

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.452
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

01:35:47.166 --> 01:35:50.167
None who venture there ever return.

01:35:51.379 --> 01:35:53.253
That mountain is evil.

01:36:16.195 --> 01:36:18.022
Aragorn.

01:36:18.781 --> 01:36:20.690
Let's find some food.

01:36:37.175 --> 01:36:38.585
There.

01:36:39.552 --> 01:36:42.553
A true esquire of Rohan.

01:36:46.184 --> 01:36:48.176
I'm ready.

01:36:49.771 --> 01:36:51.051
Sorry.

01:36:51.230 --> 01:36:53.472
It isn't all that dangerous.

01:36:53.983 --> 01:36:56.308
It's not even sharp.

01:36:56.986 --> 01:37:00.402
Well, that's no good. You won't kill
many Orcs with a blunt blade.

01:37:00.573 --> 01:37:02.067
Come on.

01:37:06.450 --> 01:37:08.940
To the smithy. Go!

01:37:10.412 --> 01:37:12.951
You should not encourage him.

01:37:13.124 --> 01:37:15.578
You should not doubt him.

01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:19.034
I do not doubt his heart,
only the reach of his arm.

01:37:21.755 --> 01:37:23.333
Why should Merry be left behind?

01:37:23.506 --> 01:37:26.128
He has as much cause
to go to war as you.

01:37:28.302 --> 01:37:31.470
Why can he not fight
for those he loves?

01:37:34.725 --> 01:37:37.725
You know as little of war
as that Hobbit.

01:37:38.979 --> 01:37:41.053
When the fear takes him...

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:46.271
...and the blood and the screams
and the horror of battle take hold...

01:37:46.651 --> 01:37:48.811
...do you think he would stand and fight?

01:37:51.363 --> 01:37:52.989
He would flee.

01:37:53.158 --> 01:37:55.196
And he would be right to do so.

01:37:57.412 --> 01:38:01.360
War is the province of Men, Éowyn.

01:38:37.029 --> 01:38:40.731
I choose a mortal life.

01:38:43.661 --> 01:38:46.530
I wish I could've seen him...

01:38:47.664 --> 01:38:50.368
...one last time.

01:39:01.551 --> 01:39:02.963
Sir?

01:39:04.804 --> 01:39:07.378
King Théoden awaits you, my lord.

01:39:28.157 --> 01:39:30.116
I take my leave.

01:39:44.757 --> 01:39:46.000
My lord Elrond.

01:39:46.590 --> 01:39:50.088
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.171
Arwen is dying.

01:39:59.977 --> 01:40:04.021
She will not long survive the evil
that now spreads from Mordor.

01:40:04.772 --> 01:40:08.143
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

01:40:08.319 --> 01:40:12.316
As Sauron's power grows,
her strength wanes.

01:40:12.489 --> 01:40:16.237
Arwen's life is now tied
to the fate of the Ring.

01:40:16.993 --> 01:40:19.565
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

01:40:19.953 --> 01:40:21.614
The end has come.

01:40:21.998 --> 01:40:24.618
It will not be our end, but his.

01:40:25.375 --> 01:40:28.957
You ride to war, but not to victory.

01:40:29.962 --> 01:40:33.627
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith,
this you know.

01:40:33.799 --> 01:40:38.211
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

01:40:38.678 --> 01:40:42.093
A fleet of Corsair ships sails
from the south.

01:40:42.724 --> 01:40:44.800
They'll be in the city in two days.

01:40:45.307 --> 01:40:48.144
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

01:40:48.855 --> 01:40:50.976
You need more men.

01:40:51.356 --> 01:40:53.099
There are none.

01:40:54.858 --> 01:40:58.774
There are those who dwell
in the mountain.

01:41:07.787 --> 01:41:09.945
Murderers...

01:41:10.123 --> 01:41:11.533
...traitors.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.160
You would call upon them to fight?

01:41:16.337 --> 01:41:17.913
They believe in nothing.

01:41:18.087 --> 01:41:20.211
They answer to no one.

01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:23.465
They will answer
to the king of Gondor.

01:41:30.599 --> 01:41:35.724
Andûril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

01:41:50.031 --> 01:41:54.443
Sauron will not have forgotten
the Sword of Elendil.

01:42:08.506 --> 01:42:13.251
The blade that was broken
shall return to Minas Tirith.

01:42:13.427 --> 01:42:15.835
The man who can wield
the power of this sword...

01:42:16.014 --> 01:42:19.881
...can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

01:42:21.728 --> 01:42:23.885
Put aside the Ranger.

01:42:24.062 --> 01:42:27.395
Become who you were born to be.

01:42:27.565 --> 01:42:29.558
Take the Dimholt road.

01:42:33.571 --> 01:42:36.357
I give hope to Men.

01:42:39.618 --> 01:42:43.746
I keep none for myself.

01:42:55.590 --> 01:42:57.250
Why are you doing this?

01:42:57.718 --> 01:43:00.920
The war lies to the east.
You cannot leave on the eve of battle.

01:43:03.348 --> 01:43:05.422
You cannot abandon the men.

01:43:06.725 --> 01:43:08.302
Éowyn...

01:43:08.476 --> 01:43:10.683
We need you here.

01:43:11.814 --> 01:43:13.685
Why have you come?

01:43:15.359 --> 01:43:17.316
Do you not know?

01:43:26.616 --> 01:43:29.618
It is but a shadow and a thought
that you love.

01:43:33.541 --> 01:43:35.946
I cannot give you what you seek.

01:43:49.472 --> 01:43:53.385
I have wished you joy
since first I saw you.

01:44:12.534 --> 01:44:14.821
Just where do you think
you're off to?

01:44:14.994 --> 01:44:16.322
Not this time.

01:44:16.495 --> 01:44:18.701
This time you must stay, Gimli.

01:44:21.417 --> 01:44:24.250
Have you learned nothing
of the stubbornness of Dwarves?

01:44:24.419 --> 01:44:28.083
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.558
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

01:44:52.902 --> 01:44:54.775
Where's he going?

01:44:57.365 --> 01:44:59.403
I don't understand.

01:45:03.827 --> 01:45:05.619
Lord Aragorn!

01:45:06.039 --> 01:45:08.743
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

01:45:09.958 --> 01:45:12.035
He leaves because there is no hope.

01:45:12.710 --> 01:45:14.833
He leaves because he must.

01:45:15.004 --> 01:45:16.713
Too few have come.

01:45:16.882 --> 01:45:19.039
We cannot defeat
the armies of Mordor.

01:45:21.553 --> 01:45:23.212
No...

01:45:23.637 --> 01:45:24.882
...we cannot.

01:45:27.765 --> 01:45:31.549
But we will meet them
in battle nonetheless.

01:45:45.989 --> 01:45:47.733
I have left instruction.

01:45:50.409 --> 01:45:53.661
The people are to follow
your rule in my stead.

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:02.495
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

01:46:03.755 --> 01:46:06.591
Long may you defend Edoras...

01:46:06.759 --> 01:46:09.082
...if the battle goes ill.

01:46:10.178 --> 01:46:13.593
What other duty would you
have me do, my lord?

01:46:15.808 --> 01:46:17.765
Duty?

01:46:19.936 --> 01:46:21.266
No.

01:46:29.571 --> 01:46:31.693
I would have you smile again...

01:46:35.118 --> 01:46:40.109
...not grieve for those
whose time has come.

01:46:44.957 --> 01:46:48.458
You shall live to see
these days renewed...

01:46:52.799 --> 01:46:55.550
...and no more despair.

01:47:01.766 --> 01:47:05.465
What kind of army would linger
in such a place?

01:47:05.644 --> 01:47:07.471
One that is cursed.

01:47:09.439 --> 01:47:11.977
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains
swore an oath...

01:47:12.398 --> 01:47:15.151
...to the last king of Gondor...

01:47:15.737 --> 01:47:17.312
...to come to his aid...

01:47:17.486 --> 01:47:19.195
...to fight.

01:47:19.698 --> 01:47:21.854
But when the time came...

01:47:22.491 --> 01:47:25.113
...when Gondor's need was dire...

01:47:25.286 --> 01:47:27.158
...they fled...

01:47:27.329 --> 01:47:30.699
...vanishing into the darkness
of the mountain.

01:47:31.749 --> 01:47:34.075
And so Isildur cursed them...

01:47:35.627 --> 01:47:39.496
...never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.

01:47:43.802 --> 01:47:46.968
Who shall call them
from the grey twilight?

01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:49.671
The forgotten people.

01:47:49.848 --> 01:47:52.340
The heir of him to whom
the oath they swore.

01:47:52.811 --> 01:47:54.683
From the north shall he come.

01:47:55.187 --> 01:47:56.847
Need shall drive him.

01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:01.438
He shall pass the door
to the Paths of the Dead.

01:48:19.917 --> 01:48:23.202
The very warmth of my blood
seems stolen away.

01:48:28.759 --> 01:48:30.713
The way is shut.

01:48:31.469 --> 01:48:33.425
It was made by those
who are dead.

01:48:34.055 --> 01:48:36.295
And the Dead keep it.

01:48:36.848 --> 01:48:38.390
The way is shut.

01:48:49.735 --> 01:48:51.229
Brego!

01:48:54.738 --> 01:48:57.444
I do not fear death.

01:49:09.752 --> 01:49:12.159
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

01:49:12.337 --> 01:49:16.998
An Elf will go underground
where a Dwarf dare not?

01:49:17.175 --> 01:49:18.504
Oh.

01:49:18.677 --> 01:49:21.510
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

01:49:36.525 --> 01:49:38.769
We must ride light and swift.

01:49:38.945 --> 01:49:40.688
It is a long road ahead.

01:49:40.863 --> 01:49:43.948
And man and beast must reach the end
with the strength to fight.

01:49:49.453 --> 01:49:52.456
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.

01:49:52.791 --> 01:49:54.782
All my friends have gone to battle.

01:49:54.958 --> 01:49:56.833
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

01:49:57.003 --> 01:49:59.124
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

01:49:59.296 --> 01:50:01.668
And none of my riders can bear you
as a burden.

01:50:02.676 --> 01:50:04.796
I want to fight.

01:50:05.301 --> 01:50:07.295
I will say no more.

01:50:24.110 --> 01:50:26.065
Ride with me.

01:50:27.529 --> 01:50:28.940
My lady.

01:50:29.115 --> 01:50:31.485
Form up! Move out!

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:34.861
Form up! Move out!

01:50:37.955 --> 01:50:39.154
Ride!

01:50:39.333 --> 01:50:42.286
Ride now to Gondor!

01:51:23.912 --> 01:51:25.656
What is it?

01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:27.372
What do you see?

01:51:27.623 --> 01:51:29.747
I see shapes of men.

01:51:32.419 --> 01:51:33.796
And of horses.

01:51:34.547 --> 01:51:35.744
Where?

01:51:35.921 --> 01:51:38.877
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

01:51:41.303 --> 01:51:43.509
Spears rise...

01:51:44.140 --> 01:51:47.589
...like winter-thickets
through a shroud of mist.

01:51:48.849 --> 01:51:51.008
The Dead are following.

01:51:52.230 --> 01:51:53.722
They have been summoned.

01:51:54.396 --> 01:51:56.224
The Dead?

01:51:56.608 --> 01:51:58.314
Summoned?

01:51:58.734 --> 01:52:00.608
I knew that.

01:52:03.947 --> 01:52:05.690
Very good.

01:52:06.408 --> 01:52:08.483
Very good! Legolas!

01:52:46.443 --> 01:52:47.854
Do not look down.

01:53:40.448 --> 01:53:45.573
Who enters my domain?

01:53:49.331 --> 01:53:51.538
One who will have your allegiance.

01:53:54.502 --> 01:53:59.841
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

01:54:00.175 --> 01:54:02.843
You will suffer me.

01:54:26.363 --> 01:54:29.734
The way is shut.

01:54:30.909 --> 01:54:35.370
It was made by those who are dead.

01:54:35.747 --> 01:54:39.910
And the Dead keep it.

01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:52.136
The way is shut.

01:54:53.888 --> 01:54:56.510
Now you must die.

01:55:00.395 --> 01:55:03.227
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

01:55:03.563 --> 01:55:08.521
None but the king of Gondor
may command me.

01:55:14.115 --> 01:55:16.271
That line was broken.

01:55:18.910 --> 01:55:21.115
It has been remade.

01:55:29.044 --> 01:55:30.586
Fight for us...

01:55:30.754 --> 01:55:33.293
...and regain your honour.

01:55:37.469 --> 01:55:38.797
What say you?

01:55:51.022 --> 01:55:52.565
What say you?

01:55:53.315 --> 01:55:55.107
You waste your time, Aragorn.

01:55:55.276 --> 01:55:58.442
They had no honour in life,
they have none now in death.

01:55:58.945 --> 01:56:01.436
I am Isildur's heir.

01:56:01.992 --> 01:56:03.947
Fight for me...

01:56:04.534 --> 01:56:08.115
...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:13.998
What say you?

01:56:21.924 --> 01:56:24.131
You have my word!

01:56:24.427 --> 01:56:28.424
Fight, and I will release you
from this living death!

01:56:29.888 --> 01:56:31.384
What say you?!

01:56:34.685 --> 01:56:37.639
Stand, you traitors!

01:57:04.587 --> 01:57:05.619
Out!

01:57:26.981 --> 01:57:28.559
Legolas!

01:57:29.694 --> 01:57:30.889
Run!

01:58:37.209 --> 01:58:39.285
We fight.

01:58:49.638 --> 01:58:52.211
Open the gate! Quick!

01:59:23.250 --> 01:59:25.241
Quick! Hurry!

01:59:39.013 --> 01:59:40.638
Faramir!

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:44.891
Say not that he has fallen.

01:59:46.062 --> 01:59:47.605
They were outnumbered.

01:59:48.021 --> 01:59:49.599
None survived.

01:59:50.315 --> 01:59:52.309
Fear.

01:59:52.858 --> 01:59:56.063
The city is rank with it.

01:59:58.406 --> 02:00:00.861
Let us ease their pain.

02:00:01.117 --> 02:00:02.859
Release the prisoners.

02:00:03.035 --> 02:00:04.992
Catapults!

02:00:18.341 --> 02:00:21.791
My sons are spent.

02:00:22.844 --> 02:00:25.760
My line has ended.

02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:30.009
He's alive!

02:00:30.183 --> 02:00:33.351
The House of Stewards has failed.

02:00:33.521 --> 02:00:34.978
He needs medicine, my lord.

02:00:36.022 --> 02:00:38.690
My line has ended!

02:00:40.193 --> 02:00:42.186
My lord!

02:00:55.707 --> 02:00:57.532
Rohan...

02:00:58.291 --> 02:01:00.701
...has deserted us.

02:01:15.141 --> 02:01:18.343
Théoden's betrayed me.

02:01:29.485 --> 02:01:31.312
Abandon your posts!

02:01:32.363 --> 02:01:36.278
Flee! Flee for your lives!

02:01:46.418 --> 02:01:47.959
Prepare for battle!

02:01:48.503 --> 02:01:51.670
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

02:01:52.839 --> 02:01:54.798
Over here!

02:01:55.551 --> 02:01:57.921
Return to your posts!

02:02:08.729 --> 02:02:11.349
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

02:02:21.532 --> 02:02:22.990
Stay where you are.

02:02:39.965 --> 02:02:41.375
We need more rubble!

02:02:41.549 --> 02:02:43.422
Watch out!

02:02:43.592 --> 02:02:46.131
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

02:02:48.012 --> 02:02:49.555
Double up, men!

02:03:58.534 --> 02:04:01.533
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

02:04:02.037 --> 02:04:05.537
Stand to your posts! Fight!

02:04:46.202 --> 02:04:47.824
Not at the towers!

02:04:47.993 --> 02:04:50.995
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

02:04:51.748 --> 02:04:53.574
Bring them down!

02:05:28.697 --> 02:05:30.736
Fight them back!

02:05:30.906 --> 02:05:32.900
Peregrin Took!

02:05:33.783 --> 02:05:36.952
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

02:05:52.634 --> 02:05:55.006
This is no place for a Hobbit.

02:06:20.742 --> 02:06:22.201
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

02:06:22.827 --> 02:06:26.160
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

02:06:37.507 --> 02:06:40.461
What are you doing,
you useless scum?!

02:06:40.635 --> 02:06:42.593
The door won't give. It's too strong.

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:51.341
Get back there and smash it down.

02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.512
But nothing can breach it.

02:06:56.442 --> 02:06:58.681
Grond will breach it.

02:07:02.111 --> 02:07:04.188
Bring up the wolf's head.

02:07:07.367 --> 02:07:12.705
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:13.038 --> 02:07:16.869
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:18.794 --> 02:07:22.210
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:22.923 --> 02:07:26.587
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:27.009 --> 02:07:31.172
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:31.346 --> 02:07:35.046
Grond! Grond! Grond!

02:07:56.079 --> 02:07:57.871
You may go no further.

02:08:01.085 --> 02:08:04.038
You will not enter Gondor.

02:08:04.464 --> 02:08:06.790
Who are you to deny us passage?

02:08:06.967 --> 02:08:10.716
Legolas, fire a warning shot
past the bosun's ear.

02:08:12.972 --> 02:08:14.633
Mind your aim.

02:08:21.356 --> 02:08:23.730
That's it. Right. We warned you.

02:08:23.902 --> 02:08:26.108
Prepare to be boarded.

02:08:27.490 --> 02:08:28.734
Boarded?

02:08:28.907 --> 02:08:30.567
By you and whose army?

02:08:32.119 --> 02:08:34.410
This army.

02:08:51.099 --> 02:08:52.927
In there.

02:08:54.603 --> 02:08:56.477
What is this place?

02:09:00.902 --> 02:09:04.271
Master must go inside the tunnel.

02:09:05.657 --> 02:09:09.656
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

02:09:11.749 --> 02:09:13.989
It's the only way.

02:09:16.379 --> 02:09:18.370
Go in...

02:09:18.923 --> 02:09:21.128
...or go back.

02:09:23.802 --> 02:09:26.588
I can't go back.

02:09:38.779 --> 02:09:41.482
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

02:09:41.655 --> 02:09:44.906
Orcses come in here sometimes.

02:09:49.873 --> 02:09:51.748
Hurry.

02:09:56.632 --> 02:09:58.588
This way.

02:10:01.429 --> 02:10:03.220
Sméagol?

02:10:04.182 --> 02:10:06.340
Over here.

02:10:14.651 --> 02:10:17.818
It's sticky. What is it?

02:10:17.988 --> 02:10:20.279
You'll see.

02:10:20.451 --> 02:10:22.775
Oh, yes.

02:10:22.952 --> 02:10:26.119
You will see.

02:10:35.006 --> 02:10:36.667
Sméagol?

02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:39.252
Sméagol!

02:10:41.974 --> 02:10:43.885
Sméagol!

02:10:53.155 --> 02:10:55.110
Sam.

02:12:35.184 --> 02:12:37.309
And you, Frodo Baggins...

02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:42.854
...I give you the light of Eärendil,
our most beloved star.

02:12:43.653 --> 02:12:46.939
May it be a light for you
in dark places...

02:12:47.115 --> 02:12:50.947
...when all other lights go out.

02:14:06.995 --> 02:14:10.284
Naughty little fly

02:14:10.459 --> 02:14:13.663
Why does he cry?

02:14:14.213 --> 02:14:17.547
Caught in a web

02:14:17.717 --> 02:14:20.471
Soon you'll be...

02:14:20.845 --> 02:14:22.673
Eaten.

02:14:59.848 --> 02:15:02.553
Got away, did it, precious?

02:15:02.726 --> 02:15:04.850
Not this time.

02:15:05.021 --> 02:15:08.105
- Not this time!
- No!

02:15:14.949 --> 02:15:18.283
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

02:15:18.744 --> 02:15:21.367
Sméagol wouldn't hurt master.

02:15:21.539 --> 02:15:23.448
We promised.

02:15:23.625 --> 02:15:26.115
You must believe us.

02:15:26.294 --> 02:15:28.003
It was the precious.

02:15:28.172 --> 02:15:32.966
The precious made us do it.

02:15:50.071 --> 02:15:52.989
I have to destroy it, Sméagol.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.337
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

02:16:15.518 --> 02:16:16.844
No!

02:16:40.085 --> 02:16:42.495
I'm so sorry, Sam.

02:16:46.970 --> 02:16:49.543
I'm so sorry.

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:20.121
This task was appointed to you,
Frodo of the Shire.

02:17:21.256 --> 02:17:23.666
If you do not find a way...

02:17:24.927 --> 02:17:26.173
...no one will.

02:18:00.009 --> 02:18:02.761
The scouts report
Minas Tirith is surrounded.

02:18:02.929 --> 02:18:05.219
The lower level's in flames.

02:18:05.683 --> 02:18:08.139
Everywhere,
legions of the enemy advance.

02:18:08.310 --> 02:18:09.509
Time is against us.

02:18:10.105 --> 02:18:11.433
Make ready!

02:18:11.606 --> 02:18:13.433
Take heart, Merry.

02:18:13.608 --> 02:18:15.814
It will soon be over.

02:18:16.403 --> 02:18:17.981
My lady...

02:18:18.573 --> 02:18:21.144
...you are fair and brave...

02:18:21.491 --> 02:18:23.900
...and have much to live for...

02:18:25.245 --> 02:18:27.654
...and many who love you.

02:18:30.418 --> 02:18:33.171
I know it is too late to turn aside.

02:18:33.715 --> 02:18:36.918
I know there is not much point
now in hoping.

02:18:38.137 --> 02:18:41.552
If I were a knight of Rohan,
capable of great deeds...

02:18:41.723 --> 02:18:44.843
But I'm not.

02:18:45.019 --> 02:18:46.847
I'm a Hobbit.

02:18:49.565 --> 02:18:52.058
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

02:18:55.448 --> 02:18:57.771
I just want to help my friends.

02:18:59.869 --> 02:19:01.364
Frodo.

02:19:02.163 --> 02:19:03.955
Sam.

02:19:05.541 --> 02:19:07.581
Pippin.

02:19:09.004 --> 02:19:12.088
More than anything,
I wish I could see them again.

02:19:16.303 --> 02:19:18.630
Prepare to move out!

02:19:18.807 --> 02:19:21.594
Make haste.
We ride through the night.

02:19:38.245 --> 02:19:39.573
To battle.

02:19:39.997 --> 02:19:41.491
To battle.

02:20:04.525 --> 02:20:06.315
Back to the gate!

02:20:06.610 --> 02:20:08.770
Hurry!

02:20:28.677 --> 02:20:33.175
I am steward of the House of Anárion.

02:20:33.350 --> 02:20:35.721
Thus have I walked.

02:20:36.937 --> 02:20:40.021
And thus now will I sleep.

02:20:46.071 --> 02:20:48.195
Gondor is lost.

02:20:48.657 --> 02:20:52.111
There is no hope for Men.

02:21:06.719 --> 02:21:09.557
Why do the fools fly?

02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:14.185
Better to die sooner than late.

02:21:16.313 --> 02:21:18.390
For die we must.

02:21:30.537 --> 02:21:33.576
No tomb for Denethor
and Faramir.

02:21:34.709 --> 02:21:40.714
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

02:21:40.884 --> 02:21:46.045
We shall burn,
like the heathen kings of old.

02:21:49.727 --> 02:21:51.555
Bring wood and oil.

02:21:54.315 --> 02:21:55.727
Steady.

02:21:55.901 --> 02:21:57.939
Steady.

02:22:12.336 --> 02:22:14.910
You are soldiers of Gondor.

02:22:15.132 --> 02:22:19.593
No matter what comes through that gate,
you will stand your ground.

02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:27.223
Run!

02:22:29.146 --> 02:22:30.640
Volley!

02:22:31.398 --> 02:22:33.274
Fire!

02:24:26.445 --> 02:24:28.486
Let him go, you filth.

02:24:30.408 --> 02:24:32.068
Let him go!

02:24:33.330 --> 02:24:35.486
You will not touch him again.

02:24:38.625 --> 02:24:40.501
Come on and finish it.

02:26:30.252 --> 02:26:31.876
Back!

02:26:42.681 --> 02:26:43.963
Mr. Frodo.

02:26:53.528 --> 02:26:55.521
Oh, no.

02:26:55.697 --> 02:26:57.654
Frodo.

02:26:57.949 --> 02:26:59.824
Mr. Frodo.

02:27:04.415 --> 02:27:05.743
Wake up.

02:27:09.589 --> 02:27:11.960
Don't leave me here alone.

02:27:13.468 --> 02:27:15.921
Don't go where I can't follow.

02:27:20.224 --> 02:27:21.600
Wake up.

02:27:28.276 --> 02:27:30.481
Not asleep.

02:27:32.614 --> 02:27:34.523
Dead.

02:27:53.303 --> 02:27:54.798
You get back, you scum!

02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:05.727
What's this?

02:28:06.901 --> 02:28:09.655
Looks like old Shelob's
been having a bit of fun.

02:28:11.658 --> 02:28:14.149
Killed another one, has she?

02:28:14.370 --> 02:28:16.326
No.

02:28:19.042 --> 02:28:21.033
This fellow ain't dead.

02:28:21.376 --> 02:28:23.667
Not dead?

02:28:23.839 --> 02:28:29.628
She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

02:28:29.970 --> 02:28:32.723
Then she has her way with them.

02:28:33.058 --> 02:28:34.765
That's how she likes to feed.

02:28:35.267 --> 02:28:37.391
Fresh blood.

02:28:37.563 --> 02:28:39.887
Get him to the tower!

02:28:43.358 --> 02:28:45.068
Samwise, you fool.

02:28:45.236 --> 02:28:48.072
This scum will be awake
in a couple of hours.

02:28:48.240 --> 02:28:50.732
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:18.272
The house of his spirit crumbles.

02:29:19.315 --> 02:29:20.776
He is burning.

02:29:21.903 --> 02:29:23.232
Already burning.

02:29:23.615 --> 02:29:25.606
He's not dead.

02:29:26.075 --> 02:29:27.736
He's not dead!

02:29:29.954 --> 02:29:31.746
No! No!

02:29:31.916 --> 02:29:34.239
No! No!

02:29:34.418 --> 02:29:36.411
He's not dead!

02:29:36.795 --> 02:29:40.247
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

02:29:40.425 --> 02:29:43.758
I release you from my service.

02:29:45.095 --> 02:29:49.426
Go now and die in what way
seems best to you.

02:29:51.602 --> 02:29:53.929
Pour oil on the wood!

02:29:55.650 --> 02:29:57.689
Come on, soldier! Move it!

02:29:58.194 --> 02:30:01.111
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

02:30:01.489 --> 02:30:02.948
Where is Gandalf?

02:30:04.077 --> 02:30:05.450
Gandalf!

02:30:10.792 --> 02:30:11.954
Retreat!

02:30:14.129 --> 02:30:15.872
The city is breached!

02:30:16.048 --> 02:30:19.004
Fall back to the second level!

02:30:22.807 --> 02:30:24.382
Get the women and children out!

02:30:24.764 --> 02:30:26.511
Get them out!

02:30:26.685 --> 02:30:28.180
Retreat!

02:30:28.354 --> 02:30:30.145
Come on. Come on.

02:30:30.481 --> 02:30:34.729
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

02:30:42.744 --> 02:30:45.152
Take them down!

02:31:05.686 --> 02:31:08.558
Fight. Fight to the last man!

02:31:08.732 --> 02:31:10.011
Fight for your lives!

02:31:10.191 --> 02:31:11.437
Gandalf!

02:31:15.823 --> 02:31:17.200
Gandalf!

02:31:17.367 --> 02:31:19.941
Denethor has lost his mind!

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:22.409
He's burning Faramir alive!

02:31:22.581 --> 02:31:24.373
Up! Quickly!

02:31:31.216 --> 02:31:32.711
Go back to the abyss.

02:31:34.218 --> 02:31:37.387
Fall into the nothingness
that awaits you and your master.

02:31:37.554 --> 02:31:44.058
Do you not know death when you see it,
old man?

02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:48.893
This is my hour.

02:31:58.455 --> 02:32:00.034
Gandalf!

02:32:08.925 --> 02:32:12.461
You have failed.

02:32:13.264 --> 02:32:18.092
The world of Men will fall.

02:33:15.374 --> 02:33:16.835
Courage, Merry.

02:33:17.003 --> 02:33:19.373
Courage for our friends.

02:33:22.925 --> 02:33:26.010
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

02:33:26.179 --> 02:33:29.429
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

02:33:37.523 --> 02:33:40.692
Éomer, take your éored
down the left flank.

02:33:40.863 --> 02:33:42.106
Flank ready.

02:33:42.279 --> 02:33:45.152
Gamling, follow the king's banner
down the center.

02:33:45.326 --> 02:33:49.027
Grimbold, take your company right
after you pass the wall.

02:33:49.206 --> 02:33:51.956
Forth, and fear no darkness!

02:33:52.124 --> 02:33:55.956
Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

02:33:56.213 --> 02:34:01.373
Spears shall be shaken,
shields shall be splintered...

02:34:01.593 --> 02:34:05.294
...a sword-day, a red day...

02:34:05.472 --> 02:34:09.057
...ere the sun rises!

02:34:16.820 --> 02:34:21.149
Whatever happens, stay with me.
I'll look after you.

02:34:27.498 --> 02:34:29.574
Ride now!

02:34:31.085 --> 02:34:33.208
Ride now!

02:34:33.796 --> 02:34:36.585
Ride! Ride for ruin...

02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:39.509
...and the world's ending!

02:34:41.431 --> 02:34:42.840
Death!

02:34:43.264 --> 02:34:46.184
Death!

02:34:46.353 --> 02:34:49.603
- Death!
- Death!

02:34:50.024 --> 02:34:51.600
- Death!
- Death!

02:34:52.317 --> 02:34:55.768
- Death!
- Death!

02:35:00.868 --> 02:35:03.276
Forth Eorlingas!

02:35:46.255 --> 02:35:47.996
Fire!

02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:53.000
Death!

02:35:57.224 --> 02:35:58.504
Charge!

02:35:58.976 --> 02:36:00.554
Fire at will!

02:36:57.918 --> 02:37:01.203
Set a fire in our flesh.

02:37:18.856 --> 02:37:20.601
Stay this madness!

02:37:24.949 --> 02:37:29.527
You may triumph in the field of battle
for a day...

02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:33.703
...but against the power that has risen
in the east...

02:37:33.874 --> 02:37:37.124
...there is no victory.

02:38:06.328 --> 02:38:08.072
No!

02:38:08.248 --> 02:38:10.917
You will not take my son from me!

02:38:11.083 --> 02:38:13.410
No! No!

02:38:24.347 --> 02:38:26.009
Faramir.

02:38:39.575 --> 02:38:43.524
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

02:39:11.067 --> 02:39:12.859
Drive them to the river!

02:39:15.613 --> 02:39:17.608
Make safe the city!

02:39:57.620 --> 02:39:59.579
Re-form the line!

02:40:00.707 --> 02:40:02.664
Re-form the line!

02:40:09.674 --> 02:40:12.297
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

02:40:12.929 --> 02:40:15.088
Charge!

02:41:34.062 --> 02:41:35.439
Cut him down!

02:42:02.135 --> 02:42:04.756
Take the reins. Pull him left!

02:42:07.142 --> 02:42:08.423
Left!

02:42:25.829 --> 02:42:27.488
Aim for their heads!

02:42:33.504 --> 02:42:36.789
Bring it down! Bring it down!
Bring it down!

02:42:50.647 --> 02:42:52.143
Merry!

02:44:05.566 --> 02:44:07.607
I didn't think it would end this way.

02:44:08.902 --> 02:44:10.314
End?

02:44:11.573 --> 02:44:13.695
No, the journey doesn't end here.

02:44:16.203 --> 02:44:19.323
Death is just another path...

02:44:19.915 --> 02:44:21.577
...one that we all must take.

02:44:22.834 --> 02:44:26.288
The grey rain curtain
of this world rolls back...

02:44:26.465 --> 02:44:30.083
...and all turns to silver glass.

02:44:32.263 --> 02:44:34.220
And then you see it.

02:44:36.144 --> 02:44:38.514
What, Gandalf?

02:44:39.648 --> 02:44:40.974
See what?

02:44:42.231 --> 02:44:44.440
White shores...

02:44:46.111 --> 02:44:48.520
...and beyond.

02:44:49.992 --> 02:44:51.783
A far green country...

02:44:52.494 --> 02:44:55.411
...under a swift sunrise.

02:44:59.458 --> 02:45:00.954
Well...

02:45:01.129 --> 02:45:02.789
...that isn't so bad.

02:45:02.965 --> 02:45:04.374
No.

02:45:06.427 --> 02:45:08.087
No, it isn't.

02:45:24.489 --> 02:45:27.823
Rally to me! To me!

02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:53.143
Feast on his flesh.

02:45:57.484 --> 02:45:59.856
I will kill you if you touch him.

02:46:00.029 --> 02:46:05.486
Do not come between
the Nazgûl and his prey.

02:47:13.903 --> 02:47:17.108
Late as usual, pirate scum!

02:47:17.534 --> 02:47:19.774
There's knife-work here needs doing.

02:47:19.952 --> 02:47:23.156
Come on, you sea rats!
Get off your ships!

02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:40.762
There's plenty for the both of us.

02:47:40.933 --> 02:47:43.010
May the best Dwarf win.

02:48:00.497 --> 02:48:02.705
You fool.

02:48:02.875 --> 02:48:06.292
No man can kill me.

02:48:08.672 --> 02:48:11.841
Die now.

02:48:22.522 --> 02:48:24.515
I am no man.

02:48:41.043 --> 02:48:44.543
- Fifteen! Sixteen!
- Seventeen!

02:48:52.348 --> 02:48:54.259
Merry!

02:49:36.271 --> 02:49:38.064
Legolas!

02:50:00.466 --> 02:50:02.839
Thirty-three, thirty-four.

02:50:49.938 --> 02:50:52.311
That still only counts as one!

02:50:52.483 --> 02:50:54.642
Come on, then. Come on!

02:51:38.369 --> 02:51:41.204
I know your face...

02:51:43.083 --> 02:51:44.911
...Éowyn.

02:51:47.504 --> 02:51:49.875
My eyes darken.

02:51:51.007 --> 02:51:52.383
No.

02:51:53.219 --> 02:51:54.843
No.

02:51:56.932 --> 02:51:59.422
I am going to save you.

02:52:00.768 --> 02:52:03.096
You already did.

02:52:06.777 --> 02:52:08.399
Éowyn...

02:52:09.902 --> 02:52:12.396
...my body is broken.

02:52:17.453 --> 02:52:19.910
You have to let me go.

02:52:25.797 --> 02:52:28.370
I go to my fathers...

02:52:29.843 --> 02:52:32.679
...in whose mighty company...

02:52:33.138 --> 02:52:36.472
... I shall not now feel ashamed.

02:52:53.078 --> 02:52:54.702
Éowyn.

02:53:41.215 --> 02:53:43.672
Release us.

02:53:45.595 --> 02:53:47.304
Bad idea.

02:53:47.473 --> 02:53:51.304
Very handy in a tight spot, these lads,
despite the fact they're dead.

02:53:51.476 --> 02:53:53.470
You gave us your word.

02:53:55.230 --> 02:53:57.355
I hold your oath fulfilled.

02:53:58.691 --> 02:54:00.022
Go.

02:54:00.904 --> 02:54:02.564
Be at peace.

02:54:45.940 --> 02:54:47.849
Merry.

02:54:48.443 --> 02:54:51.647
No!

02:54:55.573 --> 02:54:57.982
No!

02:55:21.767 --> 02:55:25.633
# With a sigh

02:55:25.811 --> 02:55:29.511
# You turn away

02:55:29.691 --> 02:55:33.687
# With a deepening heart

02:55:33.861 --> 02:55:38.605
# No more words to say

02:55:38.781 --> 02:55:42.364
# You will find

02:55:42.536 --> 02:55:46.532
# That the world has changed

02:55:46.706 --> 02:55:50.833
# Forever

02:56:15.525 --> 02:56:23.319
# And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold

02:56:27.202 --> 02:56:32.541
# And the sun is now fading

02:56:32.708 --> 02:56:42.176
# I wish I could hold you closer

02:56:45.094 --> 02:56:46.291
Merry!

02:56:47.889 --> 02:56:49.928
Merry!

02:57:01.278 --> 02:57:03.104
Merry.

02:57:05.573 --> 02:57:06.817
Merry, it's me.

02:57:09.451 --> 02:57:10.992
It's Pippin.

02:57:13.496 --> 02:57:15.785
I knew you'd find me.

02:57:15.958 --> 02:57:17.154
Yes.

02:57:19.585 --> 02:57:21.661
Are you going to leave me?

02:57:22.213 --> 02:57:23.920
No, Merry.

02:57:25.217 --> 02:57:27.457
I'm going to look after you.

02:58:11.467 --> 02:58:12.880
Hands off!

02:58:13.053 --> 02:58:16.219
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

02:58:16.473 --> 02:58:20.637
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

02:58:22.188 --> 02:58:26.018
I don't take orders from
stinking Morgul-rats!

02:58:26.858 --> 02:58:32.018
You touch it, and I'll stick
this blade in your gut.

02:58:52.716 --> 02:58:54.506
The scum tried to knife me.

02:58:54.676 --> 02:58:56.419
Kill him!

03:00:39.651 --> 03:00:41.643
That's for Frodo!

03:00:42.028 --> 03:00:44.150
And for the Shire!

03:00:47.741 --> 03:00:49.865
And that's for my old Gaffer!

03:01:19.355 --> 03:01:22.689
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

03:01:23.817 --> 03:01:28.527
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

03:01:35.870 --> 03:01:37.530
Not if I stick you first.

03:01:37.705 --> 03:01:39.248
Sam!

03:01:44.296 --> 03:01:46.334
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

03:01:46.505 --> 03:01:48.546
Sorry for everything.

03:01:49.049 --> 03:01:52.715
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

03:01:52.888 --> 03:01:55.756
They've taken it. Sam...

03:01:56.556 --> 03:01:58.052
...they took the Ring.

03:01:58.809 --> 03:02:01.515
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

03:02:13.490 --> 03:02:15.695
I thought I'd lost you.

03:02:16.076 --> 03:02:17.783
So I took it.

03:02:18.952 --> 03:02:21.028
Only for safekeeping.

03:02:22.290 --> 03:02:24.034
Give it to me.

03:02:27.586 --> 03:02:29.792
Give me the Ring, Sam.

03:02:34.468 --> 03:02:35.712
Sam.

03:02:37.304 --> 03:02:39.262
Give me the Ring.

03:02:59.992 --> 03:03:01.272
You must understand.

03:03:04.787 --> 03:03:06.615
The Ring is my burden.

03:03:07.792 --> 03:03:09.949
It will destroy you, Sam.

03:03:13.130 --> 03:03:15.086
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

03:03:16.425 --> 03:03:18.049
We best find you some clothes.

03:03:18.217 --> 03:03:21.253
You can't go walking through Mordor
in naught but your skin.

03:03:42.991 --> 03:03:45.198
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

03:03:45.703 --> 03:03:47.989
We made it to Mordor.

03:03:49.331 --> 03:03:50.991
There are so many of them.

03:03:51.959 --> 03:03:54.532
We'll never get through unseen.

03:03:59.674 --> 03:04:03.007
It's him, the Eye.

03:04:10.727 --> 03:04:13.347
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

03:04:13.811 --> 03:04:15.851
There's nothing for it.

03:04:18.858 --> 03:04:23.270
Come on. Let's just make it
down the hill for starters.

03:04:32.622 --> 03:04:35.871
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

03:04:37.208 --> 03:04:40.045
The darkness is deepening.

03:04:40.212 --> 03:04:42.583
If Sauron had the Ring,
we would know it.

03:04:42.757 --> 03:04:44.795
It's only a matter of time.

03:04:46.302 --> 03:04:48.709
He has suffered a defeat, yes...

03:04:49.763 --> 03:04:54.258
...but behind the walls of Mordor,
our enemy is regrouping.

03:04:54.433 --> 03:04:56.260
Let him stay there.

03:04:56.436 --> 03:04:59.106
Let him rot! Why should we care?

03:04:59.273 --> 03:05:04.433
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:13.691
I've sent him to his death.

03:05:15.244 --> 03:05:16.527
No.

03:05:17.038 --> 03:05:19.445
There is still hope for Frodo.

03:05:19.792 --> 03:05:23.918
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

03:05:25.005 --> 03:05:27.578
- We can give him that.
- How?

03:05:27.924 --> 03:05:30.628
Draw out Sauron's armies.

03:05:30.801 --> 03:05:32.925
Empty his lands.

03:05:33.137 --> 03:05:36.221
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

03:05:36.849 --> 03:05:39.850
We cannot achieve victory
through strength of arms.

03:05:40.018 --> 03:05:41.597
Not for ourselves.

03:05:41.812 --> 03:05:47.400
But we can give Frodo his chance
if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

03:05:49.194 --> 03:05:52.977
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

03:05:53.740 --> 03:05:54.937
A diversion.

03:05:55.117 --> 03:05:56.907
Certainty of death...

03:05:57.077 --> 03:05:59.829
...small chance of success...

03:06:00.705 --> 03:06:02.283
...what are we waiting for?

03:06:02.875 --> 03:06:05.281
Sauron will suspect a trap.

03:06:06.084 --> 03:06:08.125
He will not take the bait.

03:06:09.630 --> 03:06:12.120
Oh, I think he will.

03:06:46.539 --> 03:06:49.160
Long have you hunted me.

03:06:50.042 --> 03:06:51.325
Long have I eluded you.

03:06:53.172 --> 03:06:54.750
No more.

03:06:56.467 --> 03:06:58.873
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

03:07:43.385 --> 03:07:45.877
The city has fallen silent.

03:07:47.557 --> 03:07:50.592
There is no warmth left in the sun.

03:07:51.393 --> 03:07:53.102
It grows so cold.

03:07:56.107 --> 03:07:59.142
It's just the damp
of the first spring rain.

03:08:05.533 --> 03:08:08.734
I do not believe this darkness
will endure.

03:08:37.395 --> 03:08:38.937
Look, the Orcs...

03:08:39.481 --> 03:08:41.473
...they're moving off.

03:08:42.526 --> 03:08:44.602
You see, Mr. Frodo...

03:08:44.777 --> 03:08:47.103
...some luck at last.

03:08:47.279 --> 03:08:49.106
Move it, you slugs!

03:08:50.408 --> 03:08:53.777
Come on! Faster!

03:09:01.794 --> 03:09:05.044
Come along, you scum...

03:09:05.214 --> 03:09:09.461
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

03:09:12.344 --> 03:09:13.970
Come on!

03:09:14.138 --> 03:09:16.464
What have I told you?!

03:09:23.315 --> 03:09:24.809
Get up!

03:09:25.191 --> 03:09:27.860
Come on, you slugs!

03:09:28.027 --> 03:09:31.644
You two are going straight
to the front line!

03:09:31.823 --> 03:09:36.733
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!

03:09:49.713 --> 03:09:53.546
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!

03:10:02.935 --> 03:10:06.518
Don't you know we're at war?

03:10:28.835 --> 03:10:31.705
Company, halt!

03:10:35.550 --> 03:10:38.917
Inspection!

03:10:39.095 --> 03:10:41.549
Sam, help me.

03:10:41.721 --> 03:10:43.549
Mr. Frodo!

03:10:46.268 --> 03:10:48.806
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!

03:10:48.978 --> 03:10:50.804
It's so heavy.

03:10:59.948 --> 03:11:01.109
Oh, no.

03:11:06.746 --> 03:11:08.737
What do I do?
What do we do?

03:11:11.792 --> 03:11:12.954
- Hit me.
- What?

03:11:13.126 --> 03:11:15.165
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

03:11:15.338 --> 03:11:16.913
Get off of me!

03:11:17.588 --> 03:11:19.914
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

03:11:28.558 --> 03:11:30.597
Get off of me!

03:11:31.518 --> 03:11:33.428
Break it up! Break it up!

03:11:35.982 --> 03:11:40.525
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't
shut this rabble down!

03:11:40.736 --> 03:11:43.062
Go, Sam. Now!

03:11:51.995 --> 03:11:53.539
Move along, scum!

03:11:53.706 --> 03:11:55.615
Back in the line!

03:11:56.125 --> 03:11:57.917
You maggots!

03:11:58.588 --> 03:12:01.586
Get back into the line,
you slugs!

03:12:04.007 --> 03:12:07.459
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

03:12:10.180 --> 03:12:12.137
Move it!

03:12:56.266 --> 03:12:58.305
I can't...

03:12:58.476 --> 03:13:02.226
I can't...
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:03.553
It's... It's...

03:13:03.732 --> 03:13:06.304
It's such a weight to carry.

03:13:07.193 --> 03:13:08.223
It...

03:13:08.402 --> 03:13:10.359
Such a weight.

03:13:15.368 --> 03:13:17.775
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.

03:13:19.246 --> 03:13:22.366
There's no point carrying anything
we're not sure to need.

03:13:37.554 --> 03:13:39.382
Mr. Frodo.

03:13:40.891 --> 03:13:42.385
Look.

03:13:44.978 --> 03:13:46.805
There is light...

03:13:47.148 --> 03:13:49.554
...and beauty up there...

03:13:49.734 --> 03:13:51.441
...that no shadow can touch.

03:14:42.492 --> 03:14:44.117
Take mine.

03:14:44.617 --> 03:14:46.742
There's a few drops left.

03:15:01.968 --> 03:15:04.542
There will be none left
for the return journey.

03:15:05.471 --> 03:15:08.638
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

03:16:01.524 --> 03:16:03.684
Frodo, get down!

03:16:05.446 --> 03:16:07.353
Hide!

03:16:17.500 --> 03:16:19.536
Frodo!

03:16:25.381 --> 03:16:26.791
Where are they?

03:17:02.874 --> 03:17:05.911
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

03:17:06.836 --> 03:17:09.672
Let justice be done upon him!

03:17:53.172 --> 03:17:57.122
My master, Sauron the Great,
bids thee welcome.

03:18:02.972 --> 03:18:06.673
Is there any in this rout
with authority to treat with me?

03:18:07.061 --> 03:18:10.180
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

03:18:10.355 --> 03:18:13.309
...faithless and accursed.

03:18:13.483 --> 03:18:16.898
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.

03:18:17.069 --> 03:18:19.740
He is to depart these lands,
never to return.

03:18:20.782 --> 03:18:23.320
Old Greybeard.

03:18:24.744 --> 03:18:29.037
I have a token I was bidden
to show thee.

03:18:34.044 --> 03:18:35.374
Frodo.

03:18:38.215 --> 03:18:39.674
Frodo.

03:18:40.677 --> 03:18:41.873
- Silence.
- No!

03:18:42.718 --> 03:18:44.049
Silence!

03:18:45.848 --> 03:18:49.594
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

03:18:50.602 --> 03:18:54.682
Know that he suffered greatly
at the hands of his host.

03:19:00.193 --> 03:19:05.948
Who would've thought one so small
could endure so much pain?

03:19:08.576 --> 03:19:10.700
And he did, Gandalf.

03:19:10.871 --> 03:19:12.615
He did.

03:19:19.629 --> 03:19:21.124
And who is this?

03:19:21.298 --> 03:19:23.374
Isildur's heir?

03:19:23.550 --> 03:19:26.551
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

03:19:31.306 --> 03:19:33.880
I guess that concludes negotiations.

03:19:36.021 --> 03:19:37.217
I do not believe it.

03:19:39.232 --> 03:19:40.606
I will not.

03:19:56.707 --> 03:19:58.498
Pull back.

03:19:58.791 --> 03:20:00.831
Pull back!

03:20:13.056 --> 03:20:15.094
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

03:20:17.559 --> 03:20:20.561
The light's passed on,
away towards the north.

03:20:20.772 --> 03:20:22.563
Something's drawn its gaze.

03:20:40.080 --> 03:20:42.832
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

03:20:44.920 --> 03:20:48.915
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

03:20:51.800 --> 03:20:53.675
I see in your eyes...

03:20:54.052 --> 03:20:58.097
...the same fear that would take
the heart of me.

03:21:00.058 --> 03:21:03.973
A day may come
when the courage of Men fails...

03:21:04.144 --> 03:21:07.431
...when we forsake our friends
and break all bonds of fellowship.

03:21:07.606 --> 03:21:10.276
But it is not this day.

03:21:10.567 --> 03:21:13.604
An hour of wolves
and shattered shields...

03:21:13.779 --> 03:21:16.650
...when the age of Men
comes crashing down.

03:21:16.823 --> 03:21:19.281
But it is not this day.

03:21:19.453 --> 03:21:21.111
This day we fight!

03:21:23.581 --> 03:21:27.246
By all that you hold dear
on this good earth...

03:21:27.417 --> 03:21:31.665
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!

03:23:00.129 --> 03:23:03.665
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

03:23:04.133 --> 03:23:06.460
What about side by side with a friend?

03:23:10.015 --> 03:23:11.759
Aye.

03:23:12.600 --> 03:23:14.392
I could do that.

03:23:44.713 --> 03:23:46.790
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?

03:23:49.761 --> 03:23:52.002
It'll be spring soon.

03:23:52.806 --> 03:23:55.509
And the orchards will be in blossom.

03:23:55.683 --> 03:23:59.348
And the birds will be nesting
in the hazel thicket.

03:24:00.729 --> 03:24:04.726
And they'll be sowing
the summer barley in the lower fields...

03:24:05.776 --> 03:24:10.154
...and eating the first
of the strawberries with cream.

03:24:12.075 --> 03:24:14.564
Do you remember
the taste of strawberries?

03:24:16.161 --> 03:24:17.869
No, Sam.

03:24:18.037 --> 03:24:20.990
I can't recall the taste of food...

03:24:22.124 --> 03:24:25.410
...nor the sound of water...

03:24:25.586 --> 03:24:29.170
...nor the touch of grass.

03:24:30.132 --> 03:24:31.675
I'm...

03:24:32.552 --> 03:24:33.926
...naked in the dark.

03:24:35.595 --> 03:24:37.885
There's-- There's nothing.

03:24:38.057 --> 03:24:42.765
No veil between me
and the wheel of fire.

03:24:44.021 --> 03:24:45.929
I can see him...

03:24:46.357 --> 03:24:48.015
...with my waking eyes.

03:24:49.067 --> 03:24:51.523
Then let us be rid of it...

03:24:52.110 --> 03:24:54.354
...once and for all.

03:24:55.073 --> 03:24:57.147
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

03:24:57.324 --> 03:24:59.946
I can't carry it for you...

03:25:00.370 --> 03:25:02.407
...but I can carry you.

03:25:02.956 --> 03:25:04.698
Come on!

03:25:35.109 --> 03:25:38.064
Aragorn.

03:25:49.625 --> 03:25:52.246
Elessar.

03:26:04.223 --> 03:26:06.629
For Frodo.

03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:43.085
Look, Mr. Frodo.

03:26:43.801 --> 03:26:46.006
A doorway.

03:26:46.595 --> 03:26:48.255
We're almost there.

03:26:50.600 --> 03:26:54.547
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

03:27:08.490 --> 03:27:10.149
Mustn't go that way.

03:27:11.701 --> 03:27:14.158
Mustn't hurt the precious.

03:27:14.329 --> 03:27:16.073
You swore!

03:27:16.248 --> 03:27:18.324
You swore on the precious!

03:27:20.211 --> 03:27:22.167
Sméagol promised!

03:27:23.087 --> 03:27:25.082
Sméagol lied.

03:28:17.597 --> 03:28:19.472
Frodo!

03:28:46.584 --> 03:28:48.328
Eagles.

03:28:49.754 --> 03:28:51.247
The eagles are coming!

03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:15.941
Frodo!

03:29:21.199 --> 03:29:22.482
I'm here, Sam.

03:29:29.957 --> 03:29:31.582
Destroy it!

03:29:42.135 --> 03:29:45.420
Go on! Now!

03:29:45.597 --> 03:29:48.136
Throw it in the fire!

03:30:01.531 --> 03:30:04.200
What are you waiting for?

03:30:06.075 --> 03:30:08.448
Just let it go!

03:30:41.651 --> 03:30:43.894
The Ring is mine.

03:30:47.448 --> 03:30:49.191
No.

03:30:49.617 --> 03:30:50.897
No.

03:30:59.335 --> 03:31:02.004
No!

03:32:46.436 --> 03:32:48.309
Yes!

03:32:49.480 --> 03:32:51.188
Yes!

03:32:52.317 --> 03:32:55.186
Precious! Precious!

03:32:55.360 --> 03:32:58.529
Precious! Precious!

03:33:51.456 --> 03:33:53.282
Give me your hand!

03:34:01.632 --> 03:34:04.040
Take my hand!

03:34:06.721 --> 03:34:08.049
No!

03:34:15.312 --> 03:34:17.268
Don't you let go.

03:34:21.860 --> 03:34:23.437
Don't let go.

03:34:25.071 --> 03:34:26.530
Reach!

03:35:55.699 --> 03:35:58.570
Frodo!

03:35:59.161 --> 03:36:02.162
Frodo!

03:37:23.532 --> 03:37:25.359
It's gone.

03:37:29.829 --> 03:37:31.572
It's done.

03:37:32.082 --> 03:37:34.075
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:37.868
It's over now.

03:38:03.528 --> 03:38:05.899
I can see the Shire.

03:38:08.117 --> 03:38:10.440
The Brandywine River.

03:38:12.580 --> 03:38:14.570
Bag End.

03:38:16.917 --> 03:38:19.620
Gandalf's fireworks.

03:38:20.045 --> 03:38:23.793
The lights in the Party Tree.

03:38:25.299 --> 03:38:28.418
Rosie Cotton dancing.

03:38:29.554 --> 03:38:32.258
She had ribbons in her hair.

03:38:35.183 --> 03:38:38.139
If ever I was to marry someone...

03:38:39.063 --> 03:38:41.303
...it would've been her.

03:38:42.733 --> 03:38:44.808
It would've been her.

03:38:56.996 --> 03:39:00.162
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...

03:39:04.461 --> 03:39:07.378
...here at the end of all things.

03:40:57.069 --> 03:40:59.108
Gandalf?

03:41:18.756 --> 03:41:20.747
Frodo!

03:41:40.527 --> 03:41:42.352
Gimli!

03:43:25.333 --> 03:43:29.082
Now come the days of the king.

03:43:34.092 --> 03:43:36.417
May they be blessed.

03:43:56.697 --> 03:43:59.367
This day does not belong to one man...

03:43:59.532 --> 03:44:01.405
...but to all.

03:44:03.077 --> 03:44:05.997
Let us together rebuild this world...

03:44:06.165 --> 03:44:10.411
...that we may share
in the days of peace.

03:46:44.899 --> 03:46:46.974
My friends...

03:46:52.278 --> 03:46:54.949
...you bow to no one.

03:47:39.116 --> 03:47:41.239
And thus it was.

03:47:41.409 --> 03:47:45.028
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

03:47:45.206 --> 03:47:47.743
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

03:47:47.916 --> 03:47:52.412
...though eternally bound
by friendship and love...

03:47:52.586 --> 03:47:54.995
...was ended.

03:48:00.011 --> 03:48:04.803
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf
sent us on our long journey...

03:48:04.973 --> 03:48:09.185
...we found ourselves
looklng upon a familiar sight.

03:48:11.730 --> 03:48:14.434
We were home.

03:48:20.989 --> 03:48:22.862
Hi.

03:48:40.048 --> 03:48:42.256
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

03:49:30.346 --> 03:49:31.923
More of the same, Rosie.

03:49:32.097 --> 03:49:34.092
Good night, lads.

03:50:31.654 --> 03:50:35.652
How do you pick up the threads
of an old life?

03:50:36.993 --> 03:50:39.199
How do you go on...

03:50:39.370 --> 03:50:44.577
...when in your heart
you begin to understand...

03:50:45.835 --> 03:50:48.789
...there is no going back?

03:50:49.504 --> 03:50:53.170
There are some things
that time cannot mend...

03:50:53.676 --> 03:50:56.593
...some hurts that go too deep...

03:50:58.346 --> 03:51:01.182
...that have taken hold.

03:51:21.869 --> 03:51:24.904
There and back again...
a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins

03:51:39.344 --> 03:51:41.217
Mr. Frodo?

03:51:44.558 --> 03:51:45.933
What is it?

03:51:47.769 --> 03:51:51.718
It's been four years to the day
since Weathertop, Sam.

03:51:52.398 --> 03:51:55.102
It's never really healed.

03:51:59.072 --> 03:52:04.314
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale
by Bilbo Baggins.

03:52:05.077 --> 03:52:08.860
And The Lord of the Rings
by Frodo Baggins."

03:52:09.373 --> 03:52:11.529
You finished it.

03:52:14.420 --> 03:52:15.913
Not quite.

03:52:16.754 --> 03:52:19.292
There's room for a little more.

03:52:21.926 --> 03:52:26.137
Bilbo once told me his part
in this tale would end...

03:52:26.305 --> 03:52:29.590
...that each of us must come and go
in the telling.

03:52:30.475 --> 03:52:33.310
Bilbo's story was now over.

03:52:33.811 --> 03:52:36.730
There would be no more journeys
for him...

03:52:36.899 --> 03:52:38.440
...save one.

03:52:39.192 --> 03:52:42.774
Tell me again, lad,
where are we going?

03:52:42.946 --> 03:52:44.939
To the harbour, Bilbo.

03:52:45.115 --> 03:52:47.819
The Elves have accorded you
a special honour...

03:52:47.991 --> 03:52:50.615
...a place on the last ship
to leave Middle-earth.

03:52:52.331 --> 03:52:53.990
Frodo...

03:52:55.416 --> 03:52:59.958
...any chance of seeing
that old Ring of mine again?

03:53:00.587 --> 03:53:02.830
The one I gave you.

03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:08.626
I'm sorry, Uncle.

03:53:11.181 --> 03:53:13.801
I'm afraid I lost it.

03:53:13.976 --> 03:53:15.766
Oh.

03:53:16.394 --> 03:53:17.853
Pity.

03:53:20.606 --> 03:53:24.474
I should like to have held it
one last time.

03:53:53.639 --> 03:53:58.679
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.

03:54:12.865 --> 03:54:16.197
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

03:54:16.994 --> 03:54:19.781
The time has come...

03:54:19.955 --> 03:54:23.241
...for the dominion of Men.

03:54:24.375 --> 03:54:27.210
The sea calls us home.

03:54:35.635 --> 03:54:37.794
I think I'm...

03:54:37.972 --> 03:54:42.348
...quite ready
for another adventure.

03:55:13.422 --> 03:55:15.712
Farewell...

03:55:15.884 --> 03:55:18.634
...my brave Hobbits.

03:55:20.596 --> 03:55:22.589
My work is now finished.

03:55:26.516 --> 03:55:31.394
Here at last,
on the shores of the sea...

03:55:32.065 --> 03:55:34.900
...comes the end of our Fellowship.

03:55:38.445 --> 03:55:40.937
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

03:55:41.616 --> 03:55:45.613
...for not all tears are an evil.

03:56:03.178 --> 03:56:05.087
It is time, Frodo.

03:56:10.643 --> 03:56:12.636
What does he mean?

03:56:15.106 --> 03:56:17.977
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

03:56:19.569 --> 03:56:22.320
And it has been saved.

03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:28.659
But not for me.

03:56:29.578 --> 03:56:32.032
You don't mean that.

03:56:33.249 --> 03:56:35.324
You can't leave.

03:56:43.800 --> 03:56:46.505
The last pages are for you, Sam.

04:00:19.588 --> 04:00:22.458
My dear Sam.

04:00:24.383 --> 04:00:27.717
You cannot always be torn in two.

04:00:27.886 --> 04:00:32.014
You will have to be one and whole
for many years.

04:00:32.766 --> 04:00:38.222
You have so much to enjoy
and to be and to do.

04:00:39.482 --> 04:00:42.648
Your part in the story will go on.

04:00:43.401 --> 04:00:45.144
Well...

04:00:47.031 --> 04:00:48.738
... I'm back.

04:02:31.338 --> 04:02:35.334
# Lay down

04:02:36.925 --> 04:02:41.337
# Your sweet and weary head

04:02:43.056 --> 04:02:46.639
# Night is falling

04:02:47.311 --> 04:02:52.139
# You have come
To journey's end

04:02:52.816 --> 04:02:56.566
# Sleep now

04:02:56.737 --> 04:03:02.406
# And dream
Of the ones who came before

04:03:04.160 --> 04:03:08.074
# They are calling

04:03:08.247 --> 04:03:12.374
# From across
The distant shore

04:03:13.962 --> 04:03:18.873
# Why do you weep?

04:03:19.051 --> 04:03:24.044
# What are these tears
Upon your face?

04:03:24.221 --> 04:03:29.262
# Soon you will see

04:03:29.435 --> 04:03:34.393
# All of your fears
Will pass away

04:03:34.565 --> 04:03:39.641
# Safe in my arms

04:03:39.820 --> 04:03:44.315
# You're only sleeping

04:03:44.490 --> 04:03:49.484
# What can you see

04:03:49.662 --> 04:03:54.903
# On the horizon?

04:03:55.084 --> 04:04:04.462
# Why do the white gulls call?

04:04:05.636 --> 04:04:10.261
# Across the sea

04:04:10.431 --> 04:04:15.674
# A pale moon rises

04:04:15.853 --> 04:04:18.559
# The ships have come

04:04:18.731 --> 04:04:24.520
# To carry you home

04:04:26.780 --> 04:04:31.324
# And all will turn

04:04:31.494 --> 04:04:36.832
# To silver glass

04:04:36.997 --> 04:04:41.245
# A light on the water

04:04:41.419 --> 04:04:46.924
# All souls pass

04:04:47.092 --> 04:04:51.302
# Hope fades

04:04:52.847 --> 04:04:57.756
# Into the world of night

04:04:58.477 --> 04:05:02.310
# Through shadows falling

04:05:03.147 --> 04:05:08.271
# Out of memory and time

04:05:08.986 --> 04:05:12.688
# Don't say

04:05:13.490 --> 04:05:18.485
# We have come now to the end

04:05:19.329 --> 04:05:23.742
# White shores are calling

04:05:23.919 --> 04:05:27.453
# You and I will meet again

04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:34.081
# And you'll be here
in my arms

04:05:35.304 --> 04:05:39.382
# Just sleeping

04:05:39.558 --> 04:05:44.385
# What can you see

04:05:44.561 --> 04:05:49.519
# On the horizon?

04:05:49.691 --> 04:05:54.485
# Why do the white gulls

04:05:54.654 --> 04:06:00.074
# Call?

04:06:00.244 --> 04:06:05.321
# Across the sea

04:06:05.499 --> 04:06:10.494
# A pale moon rlses

04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:13.458
# The ships have come

04:06:13.630 --> 04:06:19.967
# To carry you home

04:06:21.180 --> 04:06:26.305
# And all will turn

04:06:26.895 --> 04:06:31.721
# To silver glass

04:06:31.899 --> 04:06:36.026
# A light on the water

04:06:36.194 --> 04:06:40.062
# Grey ships pass

04:06:40.240 --> 04:06:45.911
# Into the west
