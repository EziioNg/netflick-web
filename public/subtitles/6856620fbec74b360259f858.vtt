WEBVTT

00:54.429 --> 00:56.029
Fuck.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.776
Fucking fuck!

01:08.985 --> 01:10.486
Watch it, old man.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.705
What the fuck? You're doing it wrong!

01:22.749 --> 01:24.625
Needle is doing what the needle does.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.836
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

01:28.004 --> 01:30.005
The irezumi does not hide the skin.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.758
The tattoo reveals
the nature of the man...

01:32.926 --> 01:36.845
...and illuminates the four noble
professions in The Book of Five Rings:

01:37.347 --> 01:41.183
The warrior, the artist, the merchant
and the farmer.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.811
If there is a conflict
between the needle and the skin...

01:43.978 --> 01:46.605
...between the mark and the man...

01:46.773 --> 01:50.943
...then perhaps the path you've chosen
is not the path for which you're suited.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.154
What did you just say, old man?

01:54.364 --> 01:55.489
Huh?

01:56.157 --> 01:58.367
I know you didn't just disrespect me,
did you?

01:58.660 --> 02:00.452
You that fucking stupid?

02:00.620 --> 02:04.039
You disrespect me and I'll tattoo
the ceiling with your fucking brains.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.378
No disrespect.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.297
You're lucky.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.343
I can't kill you
until you finish this thing. Bang.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.887
Give me that mirror.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.056
Let's see how it's looking.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.766
Not bad, not bad.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.893
Hey, boss. This just came for you.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.437
- What is it?
- A letter.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.314
So open it, dumbass.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.487
What?

02:35.655 --> 02:38.949
- What is it?
- It looks like sand.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.661
Yep. Sand.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.997
- Black sand.
- No.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.293
You know what this is?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.379
You wanna let us in on the joke?

02:52.839 --> 02:57.092
Years ago I watched a man
open an envelope like that one.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.428
There were many with him.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.557
And they laughed as you laugh now.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.519
And then it came from the shadows...

03:07.687 --> 03:11.023
...and their laughter
was drowned in blood.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.944
What came out of the shadows?

03:16.362 --> 03:17.946
I cannot say the word.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.948
What word?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.120
That night...

03:25.455 --> 03:28.165
...one of their blades struck here.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.210
I should have died
but for an accident of birth.

03:31.377 --> 03:36.256
My heart is here, on the other side.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.636
The fuck is that?

03:40.970 --> 03:43.305
It looks like a ninja, boss.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.933
A ninja?

03:46.100 --> 03:50.062
Are you kidding me? That's the word
you're afraid to say? Ninja?

03:50.939 --> 03:54.149
Ninja, ninja, ninja.
Yeah, you old fuck.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.902
Yeah, you had me going.

03:57.320 --> 04:01.657
- Ninja. That's some good shit.
- Ninja.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.848
Wanna fuck with me, huh?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.645
Wanna fuck with me?

05:15.606 --> 05:19.276
Look, you don't have to do this.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.946
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.406
I'll triple it.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.074
You hear me?

05:26.451 --> 05:28.076
I'll pay you whatever you want.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.746
You cannot bargain with it,
you cannot reason with it...

05:30.913 --> 05:34.041
...because it is not a human being.

05:34.208 --> 05:37.085
It is a demon sent straight from hell.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.879
You shut your face, old man!

05:39.047 --> 05:40.964
I'll blow your fuck--

06:01.903 --> 06:05.322
For 57 years, I've told your story.

06:05.490 --> 06:10.952
No one ever believed me,
but you are real, aren't you?

06:29.972 --> 06:31.807
Is all that for the Delgata case?

06:33.518 --> 06:34.726
This is Delgata.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.270
- And the rest?
- Evidence.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.980
For?

06:39.315 --> 06:41.191
Oh, no, not again, Mika, please.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.902
What is the problem?
You've trusted my research before.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.030
Here's a question. Which of these
does not belong in this sentence:

06:47.198 --> 06:51.118
Laptop, space shuttle,
nanotechnology, ninja.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.913
All I'm asking for is an hour.
That's all.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.751
Why do I think I'm gonna regret this?

07:00.294 --> 07:01.628
Remember the Eulmi incident?

07:01.796 --> 07:04.673
Korean queen, late 1800s,
killed by one of these ninja clans.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.716
Ozunu, I think.

07:06.884 --> 07:10.554
Now, I've been going through
the original transcripts of the trial...

07:10.721 --> 07:11.930
...of Kunitomo Shigeaki.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.935
The prosecutor questioned Shigeaki
about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.439
Shigeaki answered that he didn't know
what the prosecutor was talking about.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.357
The question
was never brought up again.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.985
But what pinged for me was the amount.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.238
The exact same amount rumored
to have been paid to the Ozunu Clan...

07:28.406 --> 07:31.783
...for the yakuza massacre that happened
last week in Osaka.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.952
So you wonder,
in this ever-changing world...

07:34.120 --> 07:36.204
...if the cost of a man's life
remains the same.

07:36.372 --> 07:40.208
Exactly. I mean, I figure these clans
are like, what, a thousand years old?

07:40.376 --> 07:41.710
They probably don't change.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.922
So I started looking at
international wire transfers...

07:46.090 --> 07:50.510
...targeting banks in the regions
of several high-profile assassinations.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.054
And bingo.
Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.307
The day before the assassination...

07:55.475 --> 08:00.395
...$1,555,999 and 90 cents...

08:00.563 --> 08:03.148
...was transferred
from the Bank of Shanghai.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.860
That is the exact market equivalent
of 100 pounds of gold.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.282
- Okay, you got me, this is interesting.
- The clans are real, Ryan.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.619
They steal children
and turn them into assassins.

08:15.786 --> 08:18.163
Look, Mika, no one's denying
the historical facts...

08:18.331 --> 08:20.749
...but this thing doesn't make sense
in a modern world.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.377
They're real. You can call them spooks
or assassins or whatever you want...

08:24.545 --> 08:28.757
...if it makes you feel better, but they are
out there and they are killing people.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.092
And nobody is doing a damn thing
to stop them.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.685
Hi. Excuse me.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.270
Would you mind?

08:43.231 --> 08:45.941
If it's not too much trouble,
could you help me with this?

09:02.124 --> 09:03.708
What clan are you from?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.962
What are you doing in Berlin?

09:07.129 --> 09:08.547
I don't understand.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.821
What is going on?

09:48.546 --> 09:49.671
You found something?

09:49.839 --> 09:53.341
I was digging around trying to see
what I could come up with and I found this.

09:53.509 --> 09:56.011
A report. A friend of mine in Moscow
tipped me to it.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.054
It was written during the Cold War...

09:58.222 --> 10:01.891
...by a high-ranking KGB agent
named Alexi Sabatin.

10:02.059 --> 10:05.312
He raises the possibility that
a number of political assassinations...

10:05.479 --> 10:08.189
...were conducted by an ancient
but sophisticated network...

10:08.357 --> 10:10.859
...he calls the Nine Clans.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.988
- Mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas.
- What happened to him?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.866
Same thing that's gonna happen to me
if I hang around with you.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.453
Kicked out of the service
for mental instability.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.164
You believe it now, don't you?

10:25.374 --> 10:27.083
Ninjas.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.378
- You gotta be joking.
- Well, then why are you doing all this?

10:31.380 --> 10:32.380
I don't know.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.300
But I can guarantee you
it has nothing to do with the fact...

10:35.468 --> 10:38.678
...that you're the most attractive
researcher I have ever worked with.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.067
Oh, Mr. Nan.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.485
Good, you are back.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.072
We had a heating problem,
and I had to go into your apartment.

10:58.574 --> 11:01.451
- Is it all right?
- It's all fixed.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.953
You keep it very dark and spare in there.

11:04.121 --> 11:07.415
And forgive me, but I couldn't help
noticing your suitcases.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.754
I told you,
my father was a very sick man.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.589
Do you have to leave Berlin soon?

11:14.757 --> 11:17.509
Not yet, but I am expecting a phone call.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.761
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:19.929 --> 11:24.057
One day, death will come for us all.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.577
Wherever you are...

11:45.413 --> 11:48.081
...wherever you may go...

11:51.794 --> 11:55.755
...you must never forget who you are...

11:56.048 --> 11:58.675
...how you came to be.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.261
You are Ozunu.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.139
You are part of me...

12:04.724 --> 12:06.766
...as I am part of you.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.478
This is the truth of your lives...

12:10.646 --> 12:14.107
...and it will remain true after death.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.153
This is my new son.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.407
I have given him the name Raizo.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.410
Welcome him as your brother.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.037
Welcome, Raizo.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.853
The body must obey the will.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.813
Hunger and thirst...

12:53.981 --> 12:58.151
...even the blood in your veins,
are the body's weakness.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.494
Master them...

13:09.330 --> 13:11.915
...and you master the self.

13:18.088 --> 13:22.050
This is the power of the Ozunu Clan.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.886
This is the way of the ninja.

13:25.805 --> 13:30.725
Eat tonight and you work
twice as hard tomorrow.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.962
What is the lesson?

14:00.422 --> 14:01.756
Look at your brother.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.259
Life is combat.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.262
You know this truth.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.265
Abandoned by your parents...

14:10.599 --> 14:14.102
...without a home,
without people to care for you...

14:14.436 --> 14:16.688
...you should have died.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.773
But instead you fought.

14:19.441 --> 14:23.528
As you did here today,
you fought and you won.

14:23.863 --> 14:29.367
In combat, you face the enemy
without doubt, without pity or remorse.

14:29.535 --> 14:33.121
To survive, you must learn
to fear nothing at all.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.568
Pain breeds weakness.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.325
Remember, suffering exists...

15:10.993 --> 15:14.329
...only because weakness exists.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.683
You must hate all weakness.

15:35.851 --> 15:39.812
Hate it in others,
but most of all, hate it in yourself.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.635
- Mrs. Sabatin?
- Yeah.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.139
I'm Mika Coretti with Europol.
We spoke on the phone.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.603
You said you read
my husband's report, yes?

17:43.771 --> 17:44.812
Yes.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.942
I understand the report caused some
problems for him within the KGB.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.237
The report caused problems
for Alexi's career...

17:53.405 --> 17:58.201
...the way Moses caused problems
for the Pharaoh. Very unpleasant.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.494
What happened?

17:59.661 --> 18:01.829
About two years ago...

18:01.997 --> 18:04.499
...after the assassination of Zhukov...

18:04.666 --> 18:08.002
...the report drew attention.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.962
After that...

18:10.130 --> 18:11.464
...everything was different.

18:12.591 --> 18:17.637
Alexi hired men to change all the locks
and put in more of them.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.598
Locks on the windows,
locks on the doors, locks on the locks.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.184
He put in cameras and motion sensors...

18:23.352 --> 18:26.771
...and lights. Everywhere, lights.

18:27.147 --> 18:30.024
"There can be no shadows," he said.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.819
"No shadows."

18:34.780 --> 18:37.365
Then one day, a man came to the door.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.660
They talked in Alexi's study
for some time, and then...

18:41.495 --> 18:43.579
...the young man left.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.541
My husband was a soldier.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.502
Member of Russian intelligence.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.838
He was not a man to frighten easily.

18:52.381 --> 18:57.385
But when I came to the door,
in his eyes I saw fear.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.054
And then he stood up...

19:00.222 --> 19:04.392
...he kissed me and told me
that he loved me very much.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.396
He said...

19:10.399 --> 19:13.234
...I should always remember that.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.904
Do you know what they talked about?

19:17.072 --> 19:20.867
No. He said it was safer that way.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.828
Can I ask how he died?

19:26.498 --> 19:28.708
The lights went out.

19:34.715 --> 19:39.552
You are the first person who has
taken my husband's work seriously.

19:41.096 --> 19:45.266
It would be good to know
that he did not die without cause.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.403
He would want you to have this.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.919
Who are you?

21:29.621 --> 21:30.871
Hiyah!

22:51.328 --> 22:53.120
Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?

22:53.830 --> 22:55.623
You think this is pain.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.458
You are mistaken.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.977
That is true pain.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.814
Here is your test, Raizo.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.649
Survive the night.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.712
Very good, Raizo.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.839
Very good.

24:37.309 --> 24:41.020
Boy, you're like a dog with a bone
on that computer, aren't you?

24:41.188 --> 24:42.229
Excuse me?

24:43.023 --> 24:44.565
Agent Zabranski...

24:44.774 --> 24:46.734
...internal Affairs.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.403
Need to ask you a couple of questions.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.615
- You're Mika Coretti, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

24:52.782 --> 24:55.117
Forensic researcher.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.661
You work a lot with Agent Maslow,
that right?

24:58.079 --> 24:59.997
A few cases, yeah.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.917
You have something
of a social relationship.

25:03.084 --> 25:06.587
- Excuse me?
- You had lunch with him on the 13th...

25:07.005 --> 25:08.756
...and again on the 18th.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.257
How do you know that?

25:11.468 --> 25:14.011
- Isn't it true?
- I'm not sure.

25:14.179 --> 25:18.516
We do have lunch together sometimes,
but that's usually when we're working.

25:18.683 --> 25:22.186
Has Agent Maslow seemed different
to you lately in any way?

25:22.354 --> 25:25.940
I mean, has he said or done anything
that struck you as unusual?

25:26.107 --> 25:28.609
No. Why?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.819
Has Agent Maslow done something?

25:31.780 --> 25:33.531
Just routine.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.450
The agency cares about
its field operatives.

25:36.618 --> 25:40.204
We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue...

25:40.372 --> 25:41.705
...mental exhaustion.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.209
Agent Maslow has a serious caseload.

25:48.129 --> 25:51.423
That much work can wear on a man.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.056
- Zabranski came to my office.
- Yeah, I got a surprise visit too.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.642
- He made it real clear, Ryan.
- They're watching us.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.815
I don't get the full picture quite yet,
but I know a warning when I see one.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.859
- But why?
- Why? It's obvious.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.946
If this little fantasy of yours
has any chance of being real...

26:14.114 --> 26:17.866
...then these clans are gonna have
some pretty major juice protecting them.

26:18.034 --> 26:19.743
So, what are you gonna do?

26:20.036 --> 26:23.998
We are gonna tiptoe very carefully
from here on in, you understand?

26:24.165 --> 26:26.625
You do nothing without
checking with me first.

26:27.168 --> 26:29.878
- Got it?
- Got it.

26:52.527 --> 26:57.323
A 14th-century scroll refers to
one of the oldest of the Nine Clans...

26:57.616 --> 26:59.658
...as the Clan of Black Sand.

27:01.119 --> 27:05.539
The Islamic explorer Ibn Battuta
journeyed with a group of orphans...

27:05.707 --> 27:08.459
...that were being taken
to a remote shido...

27:08.627 --> 27:11.045
...hidden among snow capped mountains.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.465
Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner...

27:14.633 --> 27:17.468
...followed by a display of martial skill.

27:17.636 --> 27:21.805
The combatants were children,
neither beyond the age of 10.

27:22.766 --> 27:27.394
His hosts explained that a man's life
must be made meaningless...

27:27.562 --> 27:29.688
...compared to the life of the clan.

27:29.856 --> 27:32.149
Own the meaning of a man's life...

27:32.317 --> 27:34.735
...and you own his heart.

28:05.642 --> 28:10.145
You shouldn't do that. It's against
the rules. If they catch you...

28:10.313 --> 28:13.023
- Then they catch me.
- They'll put you in the box.

28:14.025 --> 28:18.112
I believe the heart of the tree
knows which way it needs to grow.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.409
- Trees don't have hearts.
- Everything has a heart.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.787
I don't.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.455
Really?

28:29.249 --> 28:30.374
Let me see.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.255
Hello?

28:40.677 --> 28:42.136
It's saying hello back...

28:42.303 --> 28:45.973
...and that it's happy to meet me,
but it misses you.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.977
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

28:50.478 --> 28:52.604
Listen to mine.

29:39.778 --> 29:44.406
For an entire year, you shall live
without one of your senses...

29:44.574 --> 29:48.368
...beginning with the sense
you rely on the most.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.058
You must see with more than your eyes.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.619
Cut him, Kiriko.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.538
All failure must be sown into the flesh.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.792
Cut him.

32:59.727 --> 33:00.852
You know the law.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.265
I told you.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.642
I tried to warn you.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.353
Yes.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.981
You did.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.108
Why, Kiriko?

34:31.778 --> 34:33.487
Why?

34:36.491 --> 34:38.658
Why am I in here...

34:39.577 --> 34:42.454
...or why are you out there?

35:37.343 --> 35:39.052
Kiriko!

35:39.971 --> 35:41.388
Why are you doing this?

35:42.932 --> 35:43.974
I have to.

35:45.059 --> 35:48.562
You know the law.
He will cut your heart from your chest.

35:49.897 --> 35:51.523
No.

35:52.066 --> 35:53.692
He can never touch my heart.

36:14.505 --> 36:15.755
Come with me.

36:16.465 --> 36:19.050
Where? What is out there?

36:19.802 --> 36:21.344
Life.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.643
My life is here.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.458
Shh.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.293
Fucking Christ, Ryan.

37:35.461 --> 37:39.839
I'm sorry I couldn't talk earlier, Mika.
They're watching me. Get in.

37:47.598 --> 37:49.808
Where have you been?
I've been calling your office.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.643
Now I know how Sabatin must have felt.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.103
What's happened?

37:53.271 --> 37:56.064
Right now I've got
Internal Affairs, Homeland Security...

37:56.274 --> 37:59.192
...the CIA and for all I know
the Martian military in my office...

37:59.360 --> 38:00.777
...tearing the place apart.

38:01.946 --> 38:02.988
What are we gonna do?

38:03.155 --> 38:05.365
You are gonna pack your bags,
go on holiday.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.533
No way.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.910
Don't argue.
I trusted you, you gotta trust me.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.538
I'm sorry, I can't let you lose
your job because of me.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.791
I'm not talking about losing my job.
Take this.

38:14.959 --> 38:18.044
It's clean, untraceable, no serial number.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.214
- Ryan?
- Yeah, I know.

38:21.382 --> 38:25.552
I've investigated world bank organizations,
drug cartels, arms dealers.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.096
I've never faced this kind of heat.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.391
For ninjas. It's fucking unbelievable.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.646
Excuse me.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.233
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.402
So, what's going on?

38:42.737 --> 38:47.907
Power's out. Us, the building behind us,
and that one across the street.

38:48.075 --> 38:50.910
It seems like every few months,
boom, the light's out.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.289
Okay.

38:54.749 --> 38:56.333
Thanks.

40:41.230 --> 40:42.355
Ah!

41:14.263 --> 41:16.389
- More will come.
- What?

41:16.557 --> 41:18.433
They won't stop until you're dead.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.393
Oh, God.

41:21.353 --> 41:22.729
A gun won't help you.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.981
Well, I don't have
a lot of options, okay?

41:25.149 --> 41:26.441
I once took a Tae Bo class...

41:26.609 --> 41:29.569
...but that is the extent
of my kung-fu abilities, all right?

41:29.737 --> 41:33.198
I can help you, but you have to trust me.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.787
Okay.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.096
Do you know me?

41:59.725 --> 42:01.309
How?

42:03.395 --> 42:07.607
Security camera in New York
recorded you fighting one of them.

42:07.775 --> 42:08.858
You know about them?

42:10.110 --> 42:11.611
A little.

42:12.154 --> 42:14.364
Well, there are these clans.

42:14.823 --> 42:19.077
And, apparently, they've been
supplying assassins to governments...

42:19.245 --> 42:21.412
...or anyone who has
100 pounds of gold...

42:21.956 --> 42:24.457
...for the last thousand years.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.793
His name was Jin.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.713
Wait, you knew him?

42:30.881 --> 42:34.133
- He was not born an assassin.
- You're from his clan.

42:35.761 --> 42:37.929
- They why did you stop him?
- They're coming.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.306
Who?

42:47.314 --> 42:51.818
It was him, the traitor, Raizo. Murderer.

42:53.195 --> 42:56.322
- Fresh kill.
- He's with the girl.

42:56.490 --> 42:57.824
Still close.

42:57.992 --> 43:00.410
Very close.

43:05.207 --> 43:08.126
Run, little brother, run.

43:09.962 --> 43:12.839
Weakness compels strength.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.508
Betrayal begets blood.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.094
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.304
Ah!

43:48.459 --> 43:50.376
We have been betrayed.

43:50.544 --> 43:54.881
A child of mine, my daughter,
betrayed us.

43:55.049 --> 44:00.094
She refused my gifts, rejected our clan.

44:01.055 --> 44:05.058
Her shame can only be purged
with blood.

44:05.476 --> 44:07.060
You.

44:11.315 --> 44:15.526
You, my son, who returned her
shall have this honor.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.809
Ah!

45:01.782 --> 45:04.867
- Where are we going?
- Doesn't matter.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.287
You think they're following us?

45:08.455 --> 45:10.081
I know they're following us.

45:10.249 --> 45:12.625
I don't see anything back there.

45:13.001 --> 45:14.794
They have our scent.

45:14.962 --> 45:17.255
Following our scent? Like dogs?

45:17.423 --> 45:20.091
No. Like wolves.

45:23.303 --> 45:24.721
My name's Mika, by the way.

45:27.641 --> 45:30.768
Raizo is the name I was given.

45:31.729 --> 45:32.979
So you're an orphan?

45:36.358 --> 45:40.611
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna try
and fill in some of the blanks here.

45:41.196 --> 45:45.992
So you must have been taken by
the Ozunu Clan, trained to be an assassin...

45:46.160 --> 45:49.829
...but something happened and you
decided to opt out of the program.

45:49.997 --> 45:52.665
Now, I don't imagine
that went over so well.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.501
Since they're after me
for just peeking through the keyhole...

45:55.669 --> 45:57.754
...they must be after you
in, like, a major way.

45:57.921 --> 46:01.174
But you're also after them,
which is why you're in Berlin.

46:01.341 --> 46:04.051
Because Sabatin is one of the few people
pursuing the clans...

46:04.219 --> 46:06.179
...which is why they took him out.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.183
But here's a question I can't answer.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.352
Why did you save me?

46:24.281 --> 46:28.326
Your entire life has brought you
to this moment.

46:28.577 --> 46:31.370
Do not fail yourself.

46:31.997 --> 46:34.040
Do not fail your family.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.045
He's wearing a gold watch.

46:39.588 --> 46:41.714
Bring it to me.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.588
That kind of tickled.

47:30.138 --> 47:33.266
It's gonna take more than a knitting needle
to fuck me up, boy!

48:11.138 --> 48:13.556
Ah!

49:09.237 --> 49:10.696
Keep it.

49:11.031 --> 49:12.531
It will remind you that...

49:12.699 --> 49:16.661
...every moment of your life
is a gift I have given you.

49:20.374 --> 49:22.708
You have made me proud, my son.

49:23.710 --> 49:26.796
Now the time has come
for you to prove...

49:26.964 --> 49:29.507
...you are true Ozunu.

49:36.348 --> 49:38.557
She tried to run from us...

49:39.518 --> 49:41.519
...from our family.

49:45.023 --> 49:48.943
Takeshi caught her
and returned her to us.

49:50.445 --> 49:53.531
Weakness compels strength.

49:53.907 --> 49:56.033
Betrayal begets blood.

50:07.129 --> 50:10.423
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

50:25.939 --> 50:27.815
Hiyah!

50:31.695 --> 50:33.362
Kill him!

51:33.882 --> 51:35.132
You need protection.

51:35.300 --> 51:40.137
No. I want Ozunu,
and I need your help to get him.

51:43.016 --> 51:44.016
Exit here.

51:52.567 --> 51:55.444
- You are a size 36?
- What?

51:55.612 --> 51:57.363
No, size 34.

52:02.953 --> 52:04.411
If you leave while I'm gone...

52:04.913 --> 52:06.789
...they'll hunt you and kill you.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.833
Do you understand?

52:27.894 --> 52:28.936
Get undressed.

52:29.729 --> 52:32.648
Shower, but do not use soap.
Do you smoke?

52:34.901 --> 52:36.235
Put your clothes in here.

52:39.906 --> 52:41.657
These jeans are a little tight.

52:42.868 --> 52:44.994
You said 34.

52:46.037 --> 52:51.417
Yeah, well, it's German sizes.
They must run a little small, I guess.

52:56.464 --> 52:59.258
This is for our scent. Right?

53:00.260 --> 53:02.011
Let's go.

53:06.641 --> 53:07.892
- Yeah?
- Ryan, it's me.

53:08.059 --> 53:11.645
- Mika, I've been calling you for hours.
- I know, I'm in a bit of trouble.

53:11.813 --> 53:13.606
You miss jury service, you're in trouble.

53:13.773 --> 53:15.816
You're in the deepest shit
you've ever been in.

53:15.984 --> 53:17.776
At least I'm not down here by myself.

53:17.944 --> 53:20.070
Sabatin's guy from the tape?
Is he with you?

53:20.238 --> 53:21.739
He's on our side, Ryan.

53:21.907 --> 53:24.283
He wants Ozunu,
but he needs the agency's help.

53:24.618 --> 53:27.119
- Be careful, Mika.
- I trust him.

53:27.287 --> 53:31.415
All right, look, I can't make any promises,
but if he cooperates, I'll do what I can.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.459
- Can you meet us?
- Where?

53:34.252 --> 53:35.544
How about the usual?

53:42.844 --> 53:44.386
There he is.

53:46.514 --> 53:49.350
Now, it's all right. He's a good guy.

53:51.353 --> 53:53.020
- Mika, are you okay?
- Yeah.

53:53.188 --> 53:54.855
Thanks to him.

53:55.440 --> 53:57.900
- Why have you done this?
- Done what?

53:58.235 --> 53:59.610
People will die.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.987
- Now!
- No!

54:02.405 --> 54:04.073
Don't move!

54:09.246 --> 54:11.830
This is wrong! No! No!

54:12.332 --> 54:13.666
Charlie 2, do you read me?

54:15.001 --> 54:16.168
Move him!

54:16.544 --> 54:19.004
What the fuck are you doing?

54:19.339 --> 54:20.881
Following orders.

54:24.094 --> 54:26.512
- Prisoner is secure, sir.
- Right.

54:26.972 --> 54:29.265
Sure doesn't look like
a killing machine to me, sir.

54:30.058 --> 54:31.684
Looks like he belongs in a boy band.

54:34.729 --> 54:37.189
He couldn't have heard that. Could he?

54:37.565 --> 54:40.442
- Sir?
- Ryan? This is wrong.

54:40.610 --> 54:42.444
I mean, it can't be legal.

54:42.612 --> 54:45.990
What is this place?
Your own private Guantanamo?

54:46.157 --> 54:49.910
It's an old GDR safe house.
Jamison wants this off the grid.

54:50.078 --> 54:52.705
You're making a huge mistake.

54:52.872 --> 54:54.540
I don't think so.

54:54.708 --> 54:58.377
I got reports from London, Washington
and Osaka, all tagging your boy.

54:58.545 --> 55:01.046
The only problem we have
is where to extradite him first.

55:01.214 --> 55:03.382
Two weeks ago,
there's no such thing as ninja...

55:03.550 --> 55:07.011
...and now every city in the world
has a warrant for one?

55:07.178 --> 55:09.346
- He is not the enemy.
- He's a killer, Mika.

55:09.514 --> 55:11.682
Weren't you telling me
it was our job to stop him?

55:11.850 --> 55:14.893
- You're not even listening.
- You're not saying anything worth hearing.

55:15.061 --> 55:18.605
Wanna do the insubordination tango?
Let's go. But not in front of the children.

55:22.902 --> 55:24.653
Boys, get out.

55:24.946 --> 55:26.989
Come on, let's go!

55:28.700 --> 55:30.159
Damn it, I am just trying to--

55:30.327 --> 55:32.661
Shut up and listen to me.
We don't have much time.

55:32.829 --> 55:34.830
Now I don't know
what we've stumbled into...

55:34.998 --> 55:37.249
...but somebody's pulling
some major strings inside.

55:37.417 --> 55:41.754
They want him dead.
He's been fighting them for years.

55:42.255 --> 55:44.089
I believe you.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.884
I've been in this business too long
not to smell a setup...

55:47.052 --> 55:49.428
...but we have to be very careful
how we handle this...

55:49.596 --> 55:52.765
...and I cannot risk
you going AWOL on me again.

55:53.183 --> 55:54.558
Now, if you get into trouble...

55:56.144 --> 55:57.770
...you switch this on...

55:57.937 --> 56:00.939
...and no matter where you are,
I'll find you.

56:23.129 --> 56:24.296
Hey.

56:27.675 --> 56:29.802
You looked thirsty.

56:59.332 --> 57:01.458
I'm sorry,
I didn't know about any of this.

57:02.210 --> 57:04.837
- I know.
- You do?

57:05.296 --> 57:08.507
The only time you lied to me
was when you told me your size.

57:11.177 --> 57:13.470
How did you know that?

57:14.097 --> 57:17.099
Your heart. It is special.

57:23.606 --> 57:27.025
- Maslow's on our side.
- He's gonna try to help you.

57:27.569 --> 57:29.570
It's too late.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.197
No one goes here.

57:32.365 --> 57:34.283
Ryan? Ryan, can I talk to you?

57:34.451 --> 57:36.452
Do we have to do this again, Coretti?

57:37.370 --> 57:38.871
I just...

57:39.247 --> 57:42.082
I have reason to believe a group
of ninja may be on their way.

57:42.250 --> 57:46.003
I think these gentlemen can handle a few
wackjobs wearing pajamas, am I right?

57:46.838 --> 57:49.214
- You see?
- Yeah, but the situation we discussed...

57:49.382 --> 57:50.382
I'm working on that.

57:50.550 --> 57:52.593
- You have to give me time.
- We don't have time.

57:52.760 --> 57:55.762
- They're not here now, are they?
- They'll be here soon.

57:55.930 --> 57:56.972
How soon?

58:01.019 --> 58:02.060
Raizo.

58:02.937 --> 58:05.731
- Mika! Go with her, secure the prisoner.
- Go, go, go.

58:07.400 --> 58:09.693
Team two, we're
on our way down to the holding cell.

58:09.861 --> 58:10.903
What's your 20?

58:11.070 --> 58:13.739
We're just now entering section four.

58:34.886 --> 58:36.428
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

58:36.596 --> 58:38.680
- Good way to get killed.
- I need that cell open.

58:38.848 --> 58:41.266
- We're moving the prisoner.
- Those are not my orders.

58:41.434 --> 58:43.310
- Mika! Get out of here!
- Not without you!

58:44.771 --> 58:46.313
Then we all die together.

59:05.166 --> 59:06.959
Open fire! Multiple targets!

59:20.640 --> 59:22.808
- Open that gate.
- I can't do that.

59:24.227 --> 59:25.269
Go to infrared, boys.

59:26.479 --> 59:28.021
They're already in the room.

59:35.863 --> 59:37.072
Open fire!

59:38.324 --> 59:40.492
We're under attack! Unknown number!

59:50.795 --> 59:52.254
Shit.

01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:03.390
Oh, Mika, Mika.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:04.600
Shh.

01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:08.228
I like you more and more.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:11.773
Okay, all right.

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:16.778
Shit.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:23.619
- Mika, hurry.
- Okay.

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:28.040
Mika, I don't wanna sound critical...

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:30.459
Look, I'm doing the best I can here.

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:36.381
- We don't have much time!
- Shit!

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:43.722
Let's go.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:00:59.946
Oh, God.

01:01:01.407 --> 01:01:03.784
We are heavily
engaged with the enemy, I repea--

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:09.581
Wait here.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.285
Let's go.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:52.749
We got two men over on the side!

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:56.962
Get down, get down!

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:58.922
Look out!

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.946
The car's upstairs. Go.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:27.409
- Go now.
- Okay.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:32.998
Murderer.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.917
Traitor. So long, brother.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:41.548
Vengeance, betrayal begets blood,
brother. Murderer.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:46.011
- Death. Kill. Murderer. Kill him.
- Just. Vengeance.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.223
Little brother.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:56.725
Come on, Raizo.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.462
Raizo, where are you?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.012
Shit.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:19.975
Ah!

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.064
Fuck!

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.235
Shit. Oh, my God. Okay.

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:34.489
Okay.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.037
Oh, my God!

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:54.486
Come on!

01:07:59.658 --> 01:08:01.326
Watch it! Help!

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:40.573
Ah!

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.178
Goodbye, little brother.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:05.723
Get in!

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.697
I can't believe I found you.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.116
I was waiting for you.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:34.586
- Ugh!
- Oh, God.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:37.755
I have to get you to a hospital.

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:40.091
No. Not a hospital.

01:09:41.552 --> 01:09:43.803
Just keep moving.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.559
- Mika, where are you?
- He told me to keep moving.

01:09:49.727 --> 01:09:51.895
- Is he still alive?
- After a fashion.

01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:54.606
Jesus Christ.
Listen, I'm gonna bring you in.

01:09:54.773 --> 01:09:57.775
- No, not this time.
- There are too many people involved.

01:09:57.943 --> 01:10:00.778
- It's just a matter of time.
- I don't think we have much time.

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:03.323
Mika.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:04.908
Shit.

01:10:49.995 --> 01:10:52.372
I know you can't hear me...

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.292
...so I'm sure this doesn't matter...

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.962
...but I'm gonna say it anyway.

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.676
I'm just a forensic researcher.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:10.890
It's like a fancy way of saying
I'm a librarian.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:16.354
By myself, I can't do anything
to help you.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:23.403
I wanted to thank you for saving my life.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:38.209
And I hope you can forgive me for this.

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:41.337
- Agent Maslow! The tracking device.
- Yeah?

01:11:41.505 --> 01:11:44.257
- You got a lock?
- Triangulating her position now.

01:11:44.675 --> 01:11:48.594
I want the International Task Force
mobilized and ready to go in five minutes.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:04.736
At last.

01:12:04.903 --> 01:12:06.404
Kill him.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:07.739
Slit his throat.

01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:09.073
No.

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:12.577
Our father should have the honor.

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:16.247
- Take him to Father.
- Bring him to Father.

01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:34.640
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.611
They took him 10 minutes ago.

01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:49.697
He's gone.

01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:20.645
You are Ozunu.

01:13:22.147 --> 01:13:26.484
You are part of me, as I am part of you.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.988
This is the truth of your lives.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:36.953
And it will remain true after death.

01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:28.212
My child.

01:14:29.506 --> 01:14:32.592
It is good to see you again.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:40.933
Do you know there was a time...

01:14:42.186 --> 01:14:44.896
...when I looked at you...

01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:47.023
...I felt such pride.

01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:53.488
No child ever showed more promise.

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:58.576
You are the son I was waiting for...

01:14:58.744 --> 01:15:00.703
...the one to take my place.

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:10.338
And now, do you know
what you have done?

01:15:10.714 --> 01:15:14.759
How you have shamed my family?

01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:17.970
How you have hurt me?

01:15:21.975 --> 01:15:24.435
Why do you think I did it?

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.400
Get this thing...

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:33.778
...out of my sight.

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:49.460
Tonight we avenge
our brothers and sisters.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:55.091
Tonight we avenge our honor.

01:15:57.886 --> 01:16:03.849
Let this death be remembered
for a thousand years.

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:17.113
Weakness compels strength.

01:16:22.744 --> 01:16:26.080
Betrayal begets blood.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:28.916
Ah!

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:35.923
You are getting weak...

01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:38.551
...old man.

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.762
Ah!

01:16:56.361 --> 01:16:57.361
Father!

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.130
Move it!

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.191
Shit!

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.823
- What took you?
- You knew I'd come?

01:17:43.617 --> 01:17:46.285
Just because I was asleep
doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.412
And I forgive you.

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.499
Mika!

01:17:56.797 --> 01:17:58.339
Come, this way.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.944
You swore to me
you'd stay inside the APC.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:22.780
- I thought we were too late.
- First team is ready, sir!

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:25.533
- Hit it!
- Go!

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.125
Stay here.

01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:50.808
You two, with me!

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.334
Come, little brother.

01:19:17.502 --> 01:19:20.212
Let us play like old times.

01:19:31.141 --> 01:19:32.683
Ah!

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:41.358
Ah!

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.215
Ah!

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.219
My turn.

01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:10.846
Watch the roof!

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.279
Do you still think about her?

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:12.950
Do you remember the sound she made
when I stuck her?

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:15.911
Ah!

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:37.433
Ugh!

01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:46.483
Ah!

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:48.611
Ah!

01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:55.409
Watch the roof!

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:59.788
- Three o'clock!
- I need a solid perimeter on the left, now!

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.393
You remember...

01:22:22.145 --> 01:22:23.646
...all I taught you.

01:22:40.538 --> 01:22:44.208
You are still Ozunu.

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:58.055
Come. Beg your father for forgiveness.

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:09.400
Ah!

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:27.334
Your heart is weak.

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.612
Raizo!

01:24:29.647 --> 01:24:33.484
All this loss, this waste...

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:38.989
...because you put yourself
before your family.

01:24:40.992 --> 01:24:43.660
This is not my family.

01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:48.999
You are not my father.

01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:52.503
And the breath I take after I kill you...

01:24:52.670 --> 01:24:54.963
...will be the first breath of my life.

01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:06.535
Ah!

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:23.510
- Mika, run!
- Where is he?

01:26:23.761 --> 01:26:25.179
Where is he?

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:27.097
Get away!

01:26:27.557 --> 01:26:29.099
Mika!

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:31.810
No!

01:26:37.275 --> 01:26:39.276
Most children are disappointments...

01:26:40.111 --> 01:26:43.238
...not worth the effort to raise.

01:27:24.364 --> 01:27:25.739
Ah!

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.984
Mika.

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.804
Jesus Christ, what happened?

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:32.681
She saved my life.

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:36.727
Medic!

01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:40.147
Medic!

01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:47.654
She'll be all right.

01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:50.532
Her heart is special.

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:54.578
I need a medic here now!

01:29:01.794 --> 01:29:04.212
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I don't understand.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:07.674
She's got a hole
right through her heart, but--

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.177
My heart is over here.

01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:09.611
Come with me.
