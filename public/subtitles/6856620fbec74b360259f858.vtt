From subpack by shocker

00:00:54.473 --> 00:00:56.236
Fuck.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:05.874
Fuck.

00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:08.816
Fucking fuck!

00:01:09.054 --> 00:01:10.544
Watch it, old man.

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:21.762
What the fuck?
You're doing it wrong!

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.666
Needle is doing what the needle does.

00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.902
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

00:01:28.073 --> 00:01:30.064
<i>The irezumi does not hide the skin.</i>

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.808
The tattoo reveals
the nature of the man...

00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:36.880
<i>...and illuminates the four noble
professions in The Book of Five Rings:</i>

00:01:37.383 --> 00:01:41.217
The warrior, the artist, the merchant
and the farmer.

00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:43.855
If there is a conflict
between the needle and the skin...

00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:46.651
...between the mark and the man...

00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:50.989
...then perhaps the path you've chosen
is not the path for which you're suited.

00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:54.189
What did you just say, old man?

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:55.525
Huh?

00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.396
I know you didn't just disrespect me,
did you?

00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:00.501
You that fucking stupid?

00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:04.074
You disrespect me and I'll tattoo
the ceiling with your fucking brains.

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:09.443
No disrespect.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.344
You're lucky.

00:02:12.518 --> 00:02:16.386
I can't kill you
until you finish this thing. Bang.

00:02:17.456 --> 00:02:18.924
Give me that mirror.

00:02:19.092 --> 00:02:21.117
Let's see how it's looking.

00:02:21.294 --> 00:02:22.818
Not bad, not bad.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:24.930
Hey, boss. This just came for you.

00:02:25.098 --> 00:02:27.498
- What is it?
- A letter.

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:29.367
So open it, dumbass.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.530
What?

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.008
- What is it?
- It looks like sand.

00:02:40.513 --> 00:02:42.708
Yep. Sand.

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.040
- Black sand.
- No.

00:02:48.254 --> 00:02:49.346
You know what this is?

00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:52.414
You wanna let us in on the joke?

00:02:52.892 --> 00:02:57.158
Years ago I watched a man
open an envelope like that one.

00:02:57.764 --> 00:02:59.493
There were many with him.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:03.599
And they laughed as you laugh now.

00:03:04.304 --> 00:03:07.569
And then it came from the shadows...

00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:11.074
...and their laughter
was drowned in blood.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.971
What came out of the shadows?

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:17.974
I cannot say the word.

00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:19.985
What word?

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.182
That night...

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:28.221
...one of their blades struck here.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:31.262
I should have died
but for an accident of birth.

00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:36.300
My heart is here, on the other side.

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:40.662
The fuck is that?

00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:43.373
It looks like a ninja, boss.

00:03:44.577 --> 00:03:45.976
A ninja?

00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:50.105
Are you kidding me? That's the word
you're afraid to say? Ninja?

00:03:50.984 --> 00:03:54.181
Ninja, ninja, ninja.
Yeah, you old fuck.

00:03:55.588 --> 00:03:56.953
Yeah, you had me going.

00:03:57.357 --> 00:04:01.726
- Ninja. That's some good shit.
- Ninja.

00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:26.914
Wanna fuck with me, huh?

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:31.680
Wanna fuck with me?

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.332
Look, you don't have to do this.

00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:23.004
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:24.474
I'll triple it.

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.141
You hear me?

00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:28.141
I'll pay you whatever you want.

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:30.806
You cannot bargain with it,
you cannot reason with it...

00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:34.079
...because it is not a human being.

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:37.122
It is a demon sent straight from hell.

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.918
You shut your face, old man!

00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:41.027
I'll blow your fuck...

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.385
For 57 years, I've told your story.

00:06:05.553 --> 00:06:10.991
No one ever believed me,
but you are real, aren't you?

00:06:30.044 --> 00:06:31.841
Is all that for the Delgata case?

00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:34.775
This is Delgata.

00:06:35.783 --> 00:06:37.307
- And the rest?
- Evidence.

00:06:37.618 --> 00:06:39.051
For?

00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:41.251
Oh, no, not again, Mika, please.

00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:43.947
What is the problem?
You've trusted my research before.

00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:47.093
Here's a question. Which of these
does not belong in this sentence:

00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:51.163
Laptop, space shuttle,
nanotechnology, ninja.

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:54.964
All I'm asking for is an hour.
That's all.

00:06:57.204 --> 00:06:59.798
Why do I think I'm gonna regret this?

00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:01.671
Remember the Eulmi Incident?

00:07:01.842 --> 00:07:04.743
Korean queen, late 1800s,
killed by one of these ninja clans.

00:07:04.912 --> 00:07:06.777
Ozunu, I think.

00:07:06.947 --> 00:07:10.610
Now, I've been going through
the original transcripts of the trial...

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:11.978
...of Kunitomo Shigeaki.

00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:16.980
The prosecutor questioned Shigeaki
about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.

00:07:17.157 --> 00:07:20.490
Shigeaki answered that he didn't know
what the prosecutor was talking about.

00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:22.424
The question
was never brought up again.

00:07:22.596 --> 00:07:25.030
But what pinged for me was the amount.

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.293
The exact same amount rumored
to have been paid to the Ozunu Clan...

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:31.836
...for the yakuza massacre that happened
last week in Osaka.

00:07:32.006 --> 00:07:33.997
So you wonder,
in this ever-changing world...

00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:36.233
...if the cost of a man's life
remains the same.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.244
Exactly. I mean, I figure these clans
are like, what, a thousand years old?

00:07:40.414 --> 00:07:41.779
They probably don't change.

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:45.980
So I started looking at
international wire transfers...

00:07:46.153 --> 00:07:50.556
...targeting banks in the regions
of several high-profile assassinations.

00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:53.089
And bingo.
Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.

00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:55.361
The day before the assassination...

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.467
...$ 1,555,999 and 90 cents...

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:03.195
...was transferred
from the Bank of Shanghai.

00:08:03.638 --> 00:08:06.903
That is the exact market equivalent
of 100 pounds of gold.

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:12.338
- Okay, you got me, this is interesting.
- The clans are real, Ryan.

00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:15.677
They steal children
and turn them into assassins.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.216
Look, Mika, no one's denying
the historical facts...

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:20.786
...but this thing doesn't make sense
in a modern world.

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:24.413
They're real. You can call them spooks
or assassins or whatever you want...

00:08:24.592 --> 00:08:28.824
...if it makes you feel better, but they are
out there and they are killing people.

00:08:28.997 --> 00:08:31.124
And nobody is doing a damn thing
to stop them.

00:08:38.973 --> 00:08:40.736
Hi. Excuse me.

00:08:41.276 --> 00:08:42.300
Would you mind?

00:08:43.278 --> 00:08:45.974
If it's not too much trouble,
could you help me with this?

00:09:02.163 --> 00:09:03.755
What clan are you from?

00:09:05.433 --> 00:09:07.025
What are you doing in Berlin?

00:09:07.202 --> 00:09:08.601
I don't understand.

00:09:31.126 --> 00:09:32.855
What is going on?

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.736
You found something?

00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:53.369
I was digging around trying to see
what I could come up with and I found this.

00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:56.073
A report. A friend of mine in Moscow
tipped me to it.

00:09:56.384 --> 00:09:58.113
It was written during the Cold War...

00:09:58.286 --> 00:10:01.949
...by a high-ranking KGB agent
named Alexi Sabatin.

00:10:02.123 --> 00:10:05.354
He raises the possibility that
a number of political assassinations...

00:10:05.527 --> 00:10:08.223
...were conducted by an ancient
but sophisticated network...

00:10:08.396 --> 00:10:10.887
...he calls the Nine Clans.

00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:15.035
- Mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas.
- What happened to him?

00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:17.933
Same thing that's gonna happen to me
if I hang around with you.

00:10:18.973 --> 00:10:21.498
Kicked out of the service
for mental instability.

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:24.209
You believe it now, don't you?

00:10:25.447 --> 00:10:27.142
Ninjas.

00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:30.449
- You gotta be joking.
- Well, then why are you doing all this?

00:10:31.419 --> 00:10:32.443
I don't know.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.350
But I can guarantee you
it has nothing to do with the fact...

00:10:35.523 --> 00:10:38.720
...that you're the most attractive
researcher I have ever worked with.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.134
Oh, Mr. Nan.

00:10:52.308 --> 00:10:53.536
Good, you are back.

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:57.110
We had a heating problem,
and I had to go into your apartment.

00:10:58.647 --> 00:11:01.514
- Is it all right?
- It's all fixed.

00:11:01.684 --> 00:11:04.016
You keep it very dark and spare in there.

00:11:04.186 --> 00:11:07.451
And forgive me, but I couldn't help
noticing your suitcases.

00:11:10.192 --> 00:11:12.820
<i>I told you,
my father was a very sick man.</i>

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:14.622
<i>Do you have to leave Berlin soon?</i>

00:11:14.797 --> 00:11:17.561
<i>Not yet, but I am expecting a phone call.</i>

00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:19.792
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

00:11:19.969 --> 00:11:24.099
<i>One day, death will come for us all.</i>

00:11:42.424 --> 00:11:44.619
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

00:11:45.461 --> 00:11:48.123
...wherever you may go...

00:11:51.867 --> 00:11:55.803
...you must never forget who you are...

00:11:56.105 --> 00:11:58.733
...how you came to be.

00:11:59.108 --> 00:12:01.303
You are Ozunu.

00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:04.178
You are part of me...

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.805
...as I am part of you.

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:10.516
This is the truth of your lives...

00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:14.155
...and it will remain true after death.

00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:18.216
This is my new son.

00:12:18.928 --> 00:12:22.455
I have given him the name Raizo.

00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:25.456
Welcome him as your brother.

00:12:25.734 --> 00:12:28.100
Welcome, Raizo.

00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:51.889
<i>The body must obey the will.</i>

00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:53.858
Hunger and thirst...

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:58.193
...even the blood in your veins,
are the body's weakness.

00:13:06.308 --> 00:13:07.536
Master them...

00:13:09.378 --> 00:13:11.972
...and you master the self.

00:13:18.153 --> 00:13:22.112
This is the power of the Ozunu Clan.

00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:24.919
This is the way of the ninja.

00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:30.799
Eat tonight and you work
twice as hard tomorrow.

00:13:56.893 --> 00:13:59.020
What is the lesson?

00:14:00.463 --> 00:14:01.828
Look at your brother.

00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:04.291
Life is combat.

00:14:05.335 --> 00:14:07.303
You know this truth.

00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:10.339
Abandoned by your parents...

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.132
...without a home,
without people to care for you...

00:14:14.511 --> 00:14:16.741
...you should have died.

00:14:16.913 --> 00:14:18.813
But instead you fought.

00:14:19.516 --> 00:14:23.577
As you did here today,
you fought and you won.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.415
In combat, you face the enemy
without doubt, without pity or remorse.

00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:33.153
To survive, you must learn
to fear nothing at all.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.621
<i>Pain breeds weakness.</i>

00:15:07.464 --> 00:15:10.399
Remember, suffering exists...

00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:14.366
...only because weakness exists.

00:15:34.057 --> 00:15:35.752
You must hate all weakness.

00:15:35.925 --> 00:15:39.861
Hate it in others,
but most of all, hate it in yourself.

00:17:32.877 --> 00:17:34.708
- Mrs. Sabatin?
- Yeah.

00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:38.212
I'm Mika Coretti with Europol.
We spoke on the phone.

00:17:41.385 --> 00:17:43.649
You said you read
my husband's report, yes?

00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:44.845
Yes.

00:17:45.956 --> 00:17:49.983
I understand the report caused some
problems for him within the KGB.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.288
The report caused problems
for Alexi's career...

00:17:53.464 --> 00:17:58.265
...the way Moses caused problems
for the Pharaoh. Very unpleasant.

00:17:58.435 --> 00:17:59.561
What happened?

00:17:59.737 --> 00:18:01.898
About two years ago...

00:18:02.072 --> 00:18:04.540
...after the assassination of Zhukov...

00:18:04.708 --> 00:18:08.041
...the report drew attention.

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:10.008
After that...

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.511
...everything was different.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:17.678
Alexi hired men to change all the locks
and put in more of them.

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:20.653
<i>Locks on the windows,
locks on the doors, locks on the locks.</i>

00:18:20.824 --> 00:18:23.258
<i>He put in cameras and motion sensors...</i>

00:18:23.427 --> 00:18:26.828
<i>... and lights. Everywhere, lights.</i>

00:18:27.197 --> 00:18:30.064
"There can be no shadows," he said.

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:32.861
"No shadows."

00:18:34.838 --> 00:18:37.432
Then one day, a man came to the door.

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:40.702
They talked in Alexi's study
for some time, and then...

00:18:41.545 --> 00:18:43.638
<i>... the young man left.</i>

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:46.608
My husband was a soldier.

00:18:46.784 --> 00:18:49.548
Member of Russian intelligence.

00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:51.880
He was not a man to frighten easily.

00:18:52.456 --> 00:18:57.416
<i>But when I came to the door,
in his eyes I saw fear.</i>

00:18:57.594 --> 00:19:00.119
<i>And then he stood up...</i>

00:19:00.297 --> 00:19:04.462
<i>... he kissed me and told me
that he loved me very much.</i>

00:19:06.738 --> 00:19:08.433
He said...

00:19:10.475 --> 00:19:13.273
...I should always remember that.

00:19:15.213 --> 00:19:16.976
Do you know what they talked about?

00:19:17.148 --> 00:19:20.914
No. He said it was safer that way.

00:19:22.253 --> 00:19:23.880
Can I ask how he died?

00:19:26.558 --> 00:19:28.753
The lights went out.

00:19:34.766 --> 00:19:39.601
You are the first person who has
taken my husband's work seriously.

00:19:41.172 --> 00:19:45.336
It would be good to know
that he did not die without cause.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.447
He would want you to have this.

00:20:53.144 --> 00:20:54.975
Who are you?

00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:30.909
Hiyah!

00:22:51.397 --> 00:22:53.160
Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:55.696
You think this is pain.

00:22:56.235 --> 00:22:57.532
You are mistaken.

00:23:14.787 --> 00:23:17.051
That is true pain.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:19.880
Here is your test, Raizo.

00:23:20.326 --> 00:23:21.691
Survive the night.

00:24:22.755 --> 00:24:24.746
Very good, Raizo.

00:24:25.257 --> 00:24:26.986
Very good.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:41.067
Boy, you're like a dog with a bone
on that computer, aren't you?

00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:42.299
Excuse me?

00:24:43.076 --> 00:24:44.600
Agent Zabranski...

00:24:44.844 --> 00:24:46.812
...Internal Affairs.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.471
Need to ask you a couple of questions.

00:24:50.116 --> 00:24:52.676
- You're Mika Coretti, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

00:24:52.852 --> 00:24:55.184
Forensic researcher.

00:24:55.355 --> 00:24:57.721
You work a lot with Agent Maslow,
that right?

00:24:58.158 --> 00:25:00.058
A few cases, yeah.

00:25:00.226 --> 00:25:02.990
You have something
of a social relationship.

00:25:03.163 --> 00:25:06.655
- Excuse me?
- You had lunch with him on the 13th...

00:25:07.067 --> 00:25:08.796
...and again on the 18th.

00:25:09.235 --> 00:25:10.293
How do you know that?

00:25:11.538 --> 00:25:14.063
- Isn't it true?
- I'm not sure.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.574
We do have lunch together sometimes,
but that's usually when we're working.

00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:22.237
Has Agent Maslow seemed different
to you lately in any way?

00:25:22.415 --> 00:25:25.976
I mean, has he said or done anything
that struck you as unusual?

00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:28.643
No. Why?

00:25:29.089 --> 00:25:30.886
Has Agent Maslow done something?

00:25:31.825 --> 00:25:33.588
Just routine.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.524
The agency cares about
its field operatives.

00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:40.257
We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue...

00:25:40.433 --> 00:25:41.764
...mental exhaustion.

00:25:42.902 --> 00:25:45.268
Agent Maslow has a serious caseload.

00:25:48.174 --> 00:25:51.473
That much work can wear on a man.

00:25:55.782 --> 00:25:59.115
- Zabranski came to my office.
- Yeah, I got a surprise visit too.

00:25:59.285 --> 00:26:01.719
He made it real clear, Ryan.
They're watching us.

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:07.851
I don't get the full picture quite yet,
but I know a warning when I see one.

00:26:08.027 --> 00:26:10.928
- But why?
- Why? It's obvious.

00:26:11.097 --> 00:26:13.998
If this little fantasy of yours
has any chance of being real...

00:26:14.167 --> 00:26:17.933
...then these clans are gonna have
some pretty major juice protecting them.

00:26:18.104 --> 00:26:19.799
So, what are you gonna do?

00:26:20.106 --> 00:26:24.065
We are gonna tiptoe very carefully
from here on in, you understand?

00:26:24.244 --> 00:26:26.678
You do nothing without
checking with me first.

00:26:27.247 --> 00:26:29.943
- Got it?
- Got it.

00:26:52.572 --> 00:26:57.373
<i>A 14th-century scroll refers to
one of the oldest of the Nine Clans...</i>

00:26:57.677 --> 00:26:59.702
<i>... as the Clan of Black Sand.</i>

00:27:01.181 --> 00:27:05.618
<i>The Islamic explorer Ibn Battuta
journeyed with a group of orphans...</i>

00:27:05.785 --> 00:27:08.515
<i>... that were being taken
to a remote shido...</i>

00:27:08.688 --> 00:27:11.088
<i>... hidden among snowcapped mountains.</i>

00:27:11.691 --> 00:27:14.524
<i>Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner...</i>

00:27:14.694 --> 00:27:17.527
<i>... followed by a display of martial skill.</i>

00:27:17.697 --> 00:27:21.861
<i>The combatants were children,
neither beyond the age of 10.</i>

00:27:22.836 --> 00:27:27.433
<i>His hosts explained that a man's life
must be made meaningless...</i>

00:27:27.608 --> 00:27:29.735
<i>... compared to the life of the clan.</i>

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.208
<i>Own the meaning of a man's life...</i>

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:34.779
<i>... and you own his heart.</i>

00:28:05.713 --> 00:28:10.207
You shouldn't do that. It's against
the rules. If they catch you...

00:28:10.384 --> 00:28:13.080
- Then they catch me.
- They'll put you in the box.

00:28:14.088 --> 00:28:18.184
I believe the heart of the tree
knows which way it needs to grow.

00:28:19.927 --> 00:28:23.454
- Trees don't have hearts.
- Everything has a heart.

00:28:24.899 --> 00:28:26.833
I don't.

00:28:27.434 --> 00:28:28.526
Really?

00:28:29.303 --> 00:28:30.429
Let me see.

00:28:35.276 --> 00:28:36.300
Hello?

00:28:40.748 --> 00:28:42.181
It's saying hello back...

00:28:42.349 --> 00:28:46.012
...and that it's happy to meet me,
but it misses you.

00:28:47.488 --> 00:28:50.013
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

00:28:50.558 --> 00:28:52.651
Listen to mine.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.470
<i>For an entire year, you shall live
without one of your senses...</i>

00:29:44.645 --> 00:29:48.445
<i>... beginning with the sense
you rely on the most.</i>

00:30:08.302 --> 00:30:11.100
You must see with more than your eyes.

00:32:33.381 --> 00:32:35.679
Cut him, Kiriko.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.614
All failure must be sown into the flesh.

00:32:40.421 --> 00:32:41.854
Cut him.

00:32:59.775 --> 00:33:00.901
You know the law.

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.313
I told you.

00:34:20.923 --> 00:34:22.686
I tried to warn you.

00:34:23.626 --> 00:34:25.423
Yes.

00:34:26.128 --> 00:34:28.062
You did.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.157
Why, Kiriko?

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:33.563
Why?

00:34:36.538 --> 00:34:38.733
Why am I in here...

00:34:39.642 --> 00:34:42.509
...or why are you out there?

00:35:37.399 --> 00:35:39.094
Kiriko!

00:35:40.035 --> 00:35:41.468
Why are you doing this?

00:35:43.005 --> 00:35:44.029
I have to.

00:35:45.107 --> 00:35:48.600
You know the law.
He will cut your heart from your chest.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.572
No.

00:35:52.115 --> 00:35:53.742
He can never touch my heart.

00:36:14.571 --> 00:36:15.799
Come with me.

00:36:16.539 --> 00:36:19.099
Where? What is out there?

00:36:19.876 --> 00:36:21.400
Life.

00:36:26.316 --> 00:36:28.716
My life is here.

00:37:32.482 --> 00:37:33.506
Shh.

00:37:33.683 --> 00:37:35.344
Fucking Christ, Ryan.

00:37:35.518 --> 00:37:39.887
I'm sorry I couldn't talk earlier, Mika.
They're watching me. Get in.

00:37:47.664 --> 00:37:49.859
Where have you been?
I've been calling your office.

00:37:50.033 --> 00:37:51.694
Now I know how Sabatin must have felt.

00:37:52.068 --> 00:37:53.160
What's happened?

00:37:53.336 --> 00:37:56.134
<i>Right now I've got
Internal Affairs, Homeland Security...</i>

00:37:56.339 --> 00:37:59.274
<i>... the CIA and for all I know
the Martian military in my office...</i>

00:37:59.442 --> 00:38:00.841
<i>... tearing the place apart.</i>

00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:03.035
What are we gonna do?

00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:05.408
You are gonna pack your bags,
go on holiday.

00:38:05.582 --> 00:38:06.606
No way.

00:38:06.783 --> 00:38:08.978
Don't argue.
I trusted you, you gotta trust me.

00:38:09.152 --> 00:38:11.586
I'm sorry, I can't let you lose
your job because of me.

00:38:11.754 --> 00:38:14.848
I'm not talking about losing my job.
Take this.

00:38:15.024 --> 00:38:18.118
It's clean, untraceable, no serial number.

00:38:18.995 --> 00:38:21.293
- Ryan?
- Yeah, I know.

00:38:21.464 --> 00:38:25.594
I've investigated world bank organizations,
drug cartels, arms dealers.

00:38:25.768 --> 00:38:28.168
I've never faced this kind of heat.

00:38:28.705 --> 00:38:31.469
For ninjas. It's fucking unbelievable.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.706
Excuse me.

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:40.308
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.452
So, what's going on?

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.985
Power's out. Us, the building behind us,
and that one across the street.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.957
It seems like every few months,
boom, the light's out.

00:38:52.796 --> 00:38:54.354
Okay.

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:56.390
Thanks.

00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:42.397
Ah!

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:16.465
- More will come.
- What?

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.505
They won't stop until you're dead.

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.474
Oh, God.

00:41:21.413 --> 00:41:22.778
A gun won't help you.

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.040
Well, I don't have a lot of options,
okay?

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:26.513
I once took a Tae Bo class...

00:41:26.685 --> 00:41:29.620
...but that is the extent
of my kung-fu abilities, all right?

00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:33.246
I can help you, but you have to trust me.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:39.860
Okay.

00:41:56.047 --> 00:41:57.139
Do you know me?

00:41:59.784 --> 00:42:01.376
How?

00:42:03.455 --> 00:42:07.653
Security camera in New York
recorded you fighting one of them.

00:42:07.826 --> 00:42:08.918
You know about them?

00:42:10.161 --> 00:42:11.651
A little.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.425
Well, there are these clans.

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:19.131
And, apparently, they've been
supplying assassins to governments...

00:42:19.304 --> 00:42:21.465
...or anyone who has
100 pounds of gold...

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:24.497
...for the last thousand years.

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:26.872
His name was Jin.

00:42:28.847 --> 00:42:30.781
Wait, you knew him?

00:42:30.949 --> 00:42:34.214
- He was not born an assassin.
- You're from his clan.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.981
- They why did you stop him?
- They're coming.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.380
Who?

00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:51.859
It was him,
the traitor, Raizo. Murderer.

00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:56.399
- Fresh kill.
- He's with the girl.

00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:57.871
Still close.

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:00.476
Very close.

00:43:05.283 --> 00:43:08.184
Run, little brother, run.

00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:12.888
<i>Weakness compels strength.</i>

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.582
<i>Betrayal begets blood.</i>

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.194
<i>This is the law of the Nine Clans.</i>

00:43:18.363 --> 00:43:19.352
Ah!

00:43:48.526 --> 00:43:50.426
We have been betrayed.

00:43:50.595 --> 00:43:54.964
A child of mine, my daughter,
betrayed us.

00:43:55.133 --> 00:44:00.161
She refused my gifts, rejected our clan.

00:44:01.139 --> 00:44:05.132
Her shame can only be purged
with blood.

00:44:05.543 --> 00:44:07.135
You.

00:44:11.383 --> 00:44:15.581
You, my son, who returned her
shall have this honor.

00:44:46.285 --> 00:44:47.877
Ah!

00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:04.927
- Where are we going?
- Doesn't matter.

00:45:06.338 --> 00:45:08.363
You think they're following us?

00:45:08.541 --> 00:45:10.133
I know they're following us.

00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:12.709
I don't see anything back there.

00:45:13.078 --> 00:45:14.875
They have our scent.

00:45:15.047 --> 00:45:17.311
Following our scent? Like dogs?

00:45:17.483 --> 00:45:20.145
No. Like wolves.

00:45:23.389 --> 00:45:24.788
My name's Mika, by the way.

00:45:27.693 --> 00:45:30.821
Raizo is the name I was given.

00:45:31.797 --> 00:45:33.025
So you're an orphan?

00:45:36.435 --> 00:45:40.667
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna try
and fill in some of the blanks here.

00:45:41.273 --> 00:45:46.074
So you must have been taken by
the Ozunu Clan, trained to be an assassin...

00:45:46.245 --> 00:45:49.908
...but something happened and you
decided to opt out of the program.

00:45:50.082 --> 00:45:52.710
Now, I don't imagine
that went over so well.

00:45:52.885 --> 00:45:55.581
Since they're after me
for just peeking through the keyhole...

00:45:55.754 --> 00:45:57.813
...they must be after you
in, like, a major way.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:01.221
But you're also after them,
which is why you're in Berlin.

00:46:01.393 --> 00:46:04.123
Because Sabatin is one of the few people
pursuing the clans...

00:46:04.296 --> 00:46:06.230
...which is why they took him out.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.261
But here's a question I can't answer.

00:46:12.237 --> 00:46:13.431
Why did you save me?

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:28.377
Your entire life has brought you
to this moment.

00:46:28.654 --> 00:46:31.418
Do not fail yourself.

00:46:32.057 --> 00:46:34.116
Do not fail your family.

00:46:36.695 --> 00:46:39.095
He's wearing a gold watch.

00:46:39.665 --> 00:46:41.792
Bring it to me.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.637
That kind of tickled.

00:47:30.216 --> 00:47:33.344
It's gonna take more than a knitting needle
to fuck me up, boy!

00:48:11.224 --> 00:48:13.624
Ah!

00:49:09.315 --> 00:49:10.782
Keep it.

00:49:11.084 --> 00:49:12.608
It will remind you that...

00:49:12.786 --> 00:49:16.722
...every moment of your life
is a gift I have given you.

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.758
You have made me proud, my son.

00:49:23.797 --> 00:49:26.857
Now the time has come
for you to prove...

00:49:27.033 --> 00:49:29.558
...you are true Ozunu.

00:49:36.409 --> 00:49:38.639
She tried to run from us...

00:49:39.579 --> 00:49:41.570
...from our family.

00:49:45.085 --> 00:49:49.021
Takeshi caught her
and returned her to us.

00:49:50.524 --> 00:49:53.584
Weakness compels strength.

00:49:53.961 --> 00:49:56.088
Betrayal begets blood.

00:50:07.208 --> 00:50:10.473
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

00:50:25.993 --> 00:50:27.893
Hiyah!

00:50:31.765 --> 00:50:33.426
Kill him!

00:51:33.961 --> 00:51:35.189
You need protection.

00:51:35.362 --> 00:51:40.197
No. I want Ozunu,
and I need your help to get him.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:44.094
Exit here.

00:51:52.646 --> 00:51:55.513
- You are a size 36?
- What?

00:51:55.683 --> 00:51:57.412
No, size 34.

00:52:03.023 --> 00:52:04.490
If you leave while I'm gone...

00:52:04.992 --> 00:52:06.857
...they'll hunt you and kill you.

00:52:07.027 --> 00:52:08.892
Do you understand?

00:52:27.982 --> 00:52:29.006
Get undressed.

00:52:29.784 --> 00:52:32.719
Shower, but do not use soap.
Do you smoke?

00:52:34.956 --> 00:52:36.321
Put your clothes in here.

00:52:39.995 --> 00:52:41.724
These jeans are a little tight.

00:52:42.931 --> 00:52:45.058
You said 34.

00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:51.505
Yeah, well, it's German sizes.
They must run a little small, I guess.

00:52:56.544 --> 00:52:59.308
This is for our scent. Right?

00:53:00.348 --> 00:53:02.077
Let's go.

00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:07.949
<i>- Yeah?
- Ryan, it's me.</i>

00:53:08.122 --> 00:53:11.717
- Mika, I've been calling you for hours.
- I know, I'm in a bit of trouble.

00:53:11.892 --> 00:53:13.689
You miss jury service, you're in trouble.

00:53:13.861 --> 00:53:15.886
You're in the deepest shit
you've ever been in.

00:53:16.063 --> 00:53:17.826
At least I'm not down here by myself.

00:53:17.998 --> 00:53:20.125
Sabatin's guy from the tape?
Is he with you?

00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:21.791
He's on our side, Ryan.

00:53:21.969 --> 00:53:24.335
He wants Ozunu,
but he needs the agency's help.

00:53:24.705 --> 00:53:27.196
- Be careful, Mika.
- I trust him.

00:53:27.374 --> 00:53:31.470
<i>All right, look, I can't make any promises,
but if he cooperates, I'll do what I can.</i>

00:53:31.645 --> 00:53:33.510
- Can you meet us?
- Where?

00:53:34.315 --> 00:53:35.612
How about the usual?

00:53:42.923 --> 00:53:44.447
There he is.

00:53:46.594 --> 00:53:49.427
Now, it's all right. He's a good guy.

00:53:51.432 --> 00:53:53.093
- Mika, are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:53:53.267 --> 00:53:54.928
Thanks to him.

00:53:55.503 --> 00:53:57.971
- Why have you done this?
- Done what?

00:53:58.305 --> 00:53:59.670
People will die.

00:54:00.307 --> 00:54:02.036
- Now!
- No!

00:54:02.476 --> 00:54:04.137
Don't move!

00:54:09.316 --> 00:54:11.910
This is wrong! No! No!

00:54:12.486 --> 00:54:13.748
<i>Charlie 2, do you read me?</i>

00:54:15.055 --> 00:54:16.215
Move him!

00:54:16.624 --> 00:54:19.092
What the fuck are you doing?

00:54:19.426 --> 00:54:21.121
Following orders.

00:54:24.165 --> 00:54:26.565
- Prisoner is secure, sir.
- Right.

00:54:27.034 --> 00:54:29.332
Sure doesn't look like
a killing machine to me, sir.

00:54:30.137 --> 00:54:31.764
Looks like he belongs in a boy band.

00:54:34.809 --> 00:54:37.277
He couldn't have heard that. Could he?

00:54:37.645 --> 00:54:40.512
- Sir?
- Ryan? This is wrong.

00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:42.512
I mean, it can't be legal.

00:54:42.683 --> 00:54:46.050
What is this place?
Your own private Guantanamo?

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.986
It's an old GDR safe house.
Jamison wants this off the grid.

00:54:50.157 --> 00:54:52.751
You're making a huge mistake.

00:54:52.927 --> 00:54:54.588
I don't think so.

00:54:54.762 --> 00:54:58.459
I got reports from London, Washington
and Osaka, all tagging your boy.

00:54:58.632 --> 00:55:01.100
The only problem we have
is where to extradite him first.

00:55:01.268 --> 00:55:03.463
Two weeks ago,
there's no such thing as ninja...

00:55:03.637 --> 00:55:07.073
...and now every city in the world
has a warrant for one?

00:55:07.241 --> 00:55:09.402
- He is not the enemy.
- He's a killer, Mika.

00:55:09.577 --> 00:55:11.738
Weren't you telling me
it was our job to stop him?

00:55:11.912 --> 00:55:14.972
- You're not even listening.
- You're not saying anything worth hearing.

00:55:15.149 --> 00:55:18.677
Wanna do the insubordination tango?
Let's go. But not in front of the children.

00:55:22.958 --> 00:55:24.721
Boys, get out.

00:55:25.026 --> 00:55:27.051
Come on, let's go!

00:55:28.763 --> 00:55:30.230
Damn it, I am just trying to...

00:55:30.398 --> 00:55:32.730
Shut up and listen to me.
We don't have much time.

00:55:32.901 --> 00:55:34.892
Now I don't know
what we've stumbled into...

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.334
...but somebody's pulling
some major strings inside.

00:55:37.505 --> 00:55:41.805
They want him dead.
He's been fighting them for years.

00:55:42.344 --> 00:55:44.141
I believe you.

00:55:44.379 --> 00:55:46.939
I've been in this business too long
not to smell a setup...

00:55:47.115 --> 00:55:49.515
...but we have to be very careful
how we handle this...

00:55:49.684 --> 00:55:52.812
...and I cannot risk
you going AWOL on me again.

00:55:53.255 --> 00:55:54.620
Now, if you get into trouble...

00:55:56.224 --> 00:55:57.816
...you switch this on...

00:55:57.993 --> 00:56:01.019
...and no matter where you are,
I'll find you.

00:56:23.218 --> 00:56:24.344
Hey.

00:56:27.756 --> 00:56:29.849
You looked thirsty.

00:56:59.387 --> 00:57:01.514
I'm sorry,
I didn't know about any of this.

00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:04.918
- I know.
- You do?

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.557
The only time you lied to me
was when you told me your size.

00:57:11.266 --> 00:57:13.530
How did you know that?

00:57:14.169 --> 00:57:17.161
Your heart. It is special.

00:57:23.678 --> 00:57:27.114
Maslow's on our side.
He's gonna try to help you.

00:57:27.649 --> 00:57:29.640
It's too late.

00:57:31.186 --> 00:57:32.244
No one goes here.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.354
Ryan? Ryan, can I talk to you?

00:57:34.522 --> 00:57:36.513
Do we have to do this again, Coretti?

00:57:37.459 --> 00:57:38.949
I just...

00:57:39.327 --> 00:57:42.160
I have reason to believe a group
of ninja may be on their way.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:46.061
I think these gentlemen can handle a few
wackjobs wearing pajamas, am I right?

00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:49.267
- You see?
- Yeah, but the situation we discussed...

00:57:49.437 --> 00:57:50.461
I'm working on that.

00:57:50.638 --> 00:57:52.663
- You have to give me time.
- We don't have time.

00:57:52.841 --> 00:57:55.833
- They're not here now, are they?
- They'll be here soon.

00:57:56.011 --> 00:57:57.035
How soon?

00:58:01.082 --> 00:58:02.106
Raizo.

00:58:03.018 --> 00:58:05.817
- Mika! Go with her, secure the prisoner.
- Go, go, go.

00:58:07.456 --> 00:58:09.754
<i>Team two, we're
on our way down to the holding cell.</i>

00:58:09.925 --> 00:58:10.914
<i>What's your 20?</i>

00:58:11.093 --> 00:58:13.789
<i>We're just now entering section four.</i>

00:58:35.017 --> 00:58:36.507
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

00:58:36.685 --> 00:58:38.744
- Good way to get killed.
- I need that cell open.

00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:41.321
- We're moving the prisoner.
- Those are not my orders.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.390
- Mika! Get out of here!
- Not without you!

00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.384
Then we all die together.

00:59:05.247 --> 00:59:07.010
Open fire! Multiple targets!

00:59:20.696 --> 00:59:22.891
- Open that gate.
- I can't do that.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.324
Go to infrared, boys.

00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:28.093
They're already in the room.

00:59:35.945 --> 00:59:37.139
Open fire!

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.575
We're under attack! Unknown number!

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.327
Shit.

01:00:01.704 --> 01:00:03.501
Oh, Mika, Mika.

01:00:03.672 --> 01:00:04.661
Shh.

01:00:06.876 --> 01:00:08.309
I like you more and more.

01:00:09.578 --> 01:00:11.842
Okay, all right.

01:00:15.451 --> 01:00:16.850
Shit.

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.684
- Mika, hurry.
- Okay.

01:00:26.295 --> 01:00:28.092
Mika, I don't wanna sound critical...

01:00:28.264 --> 01:00:30.528
Look, I'm doing the best I can here.

01:00:33.369 --> 01:00:36.463
- We don't have much time!
- Shit!

01:00:42.478 --> 01:00:43.843
Let's go.

01:00:58.995 --> 01:01:00.019
Oh, God.

01:01:01.498 --> 01:01:03.864
<i>We are heavily engaged
with the enemy, I repea...</i>

01:01:08.605 --> 01:01:09.629
Wait here.

01:01:45.609 --> 01:01:47.338
Let's go.

01:01:51.414 --> 01:01:52.813
We got two men over on the side!

01:01:55.318 --> 01:01:57.013
Get down, get down!

01:01:57.354 --> 01:01:58.981
Look out!

01:02:20.777 --> 01:02:23.007
The car's upstairs. Go.

01:02:24.547 --> 01:02:27.482
- Go now.
- Okay.

01:02:31.554 --> 01:02:33.044
Murderer.

01:02:33.223 --> 01:02:35.987
Traitor. So long, brother.

01:02:36.159 --> 01:02:41.620
Vengeance, betrayal begets blood,
brother. Murderer.

01:02:41.798 --> 01:02:46.064
Death. Kill. Murderer. Kill him.
Just. Vengeance.

01:02:49.239 --> 01:02:50.297
Little brother.

01:04:55.199 --> 01:04:56.791
Come on, Raizo.

01:06:05.469 --> 01:06:07.528
Raizo, where are you?

01:06:14.812 --> 01:06:16.074
Shit.

01:06:19.016 --> 01:06:20.040
Ah!

01:06:24.788 --> 01:06:26.119
Fuck!

01:06:27.893 --> 01:06:30.327
Shit. Oh, my God. Okay.

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.563
Okay.

01:06:39.304 --> 01:06:41.101
Oh, my God!

01:07:52.711 --> 01:07:54.542
Come on!

01:07:59.718 --> 01:08:01.413
Watch it! Help!

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:40.648
Ah!

01:08:59.911 --> 01:09:02.243
Goodbye, little brother.

01:09:04.049 --> 01:09:05.778
Get in!

01:09:19.298 --> 01:09:20.765
I can't believe I found you.

01:09:21.467 --> 01:09:23.196
I was waiting for you.

01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:34.679
- Ugh!
- Oh, God.

01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:37.815
I have to get you to a hospital.

01:09:38.284 --> 01:09:40.184
No. Not a hospital.

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.884
Just keep moving.

01:09:46.926 --> 01:09:49.622
<i>- Mika, where are you?
- He told me to keep moving.</i>

01:09:49.795 --> 01:09:51.956
<i>- Is he still alive?
- After a fashion.</i>

01:09:52.131 --> 01:09:54.691
Jesus Christ.
Listen, I'm gonna bring you in.

01:09:54.867 --> 01:09:57.836
<i>- No, not this time.
- There are too many people involved.</i>

01:09:58.003 --> 01:10:00.870
- It's just a matter of time.
- I don't think we have much time.

01:10:01.974 --> 01:10:03.407
Mika.

01:10:03.943 --> 01:10:04.967
Shit.

01:10:50.055 --> 01:10:52.455
I know you can't hear me...

01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:56.356
...so I'm sure this doesn't matter...

01:10:56.862 --> 01:10:59.023
...but I'm gonna say it anyway.

01:11:01.734 --> 01:11:04.726
I'm just a forensic researcher.

01:11:06.572 --> 01:11:10.975
It's like a fancy way of saying
I'm a librarian.

01:11:14.013 --> 01:11:16.447
By myself, I can't do anything
to help you.

01:11:20.486 --> 01:11:23.478
I wanted to thank you for saving my life.

01:11:35.501 --> 01:11:38.299
And I hope you can forgive me for this.

01:11:39.405 --> 01:11:41.396
- Agent Maslow! The tracking device.
- Yeah?

01:11:41.574 --> 01:11:44.338
- You got a lock?
- Triangulating her position now.

01:11:44.743 --> 01:11:48.679
I want the International Task Force
mobilized and ready to go in five minutes.

01:12:03.463 --> 01:12:04.828
At last.

01:12:04.998 --> 01:12:06.465
Kill him.

01:12:06.633 --> 01:12:07.827
Slit his throat.

01:12:08.001 --> 01:12:09.161
No.

01:12:09.336 --> 01:12:12.635
Our father should have the honor.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:16.307
- Take him to Father.
- Bring him to Father.

01:12:32.893 --> 01:12:34.724
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:12:44.437 --> 01:12:46.701
They took him 10 minutes ago.

01:12:48.008 --> 01:12:49.771
He's gone.

01:13:17.837 --> 01:13:20.704
<i>You are Ozunu.</i>

01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:26.577
<i>You are part of me, as I am part of you.</i>

01:13:27.714 --> 01:13:31.081
<i>This is the truth of your lives.</i>

01:13:32.585 --> 01:13:37.022
<i>And it will remain true after death.</i>

01:14:25.739 --> 01:14:28.299
My child.

01:14:29.576 --> 01:14:32.670
It is good to see you again.

01:14:36.683 --> 01:14:41.017
Do you know there was a time...

01:14:42.255 --> 01:14:44.985
...when I looked at you...

01:14:45.158 --> 01:14:47.092
...I felt such pride.

01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:53.560
No child ever showed more promise.

01:14:55.369 --> 01:14:58.634
You are the son I was waiting for...

01:14:58.806 --> 01:15:00.774
...the one to take my place.

01:15:05.146 --> 01:15:10.413
And now, do you know
what you have done?

01:15:10.785 --> 01:15:14.846
How you have shamed my family?

01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:18.056
How you have hurt me?

01:15:22.063 --> 01:15:24.497
Why do you think I did it?

01:15:29.737 --> 01:15:31.466
Get this thing...

01:15:32.506 --> 01:15:33.871
...out of my sight.

01:15:45.252 --> 01:15:49.552
Tonight we avenge
our brothers and sisters.

01:15:51.692 --> 01:15:55.150
Tonight we avenge our honor.

01:15:57.965 --> 01:16:03.926
Let this death be remembered
for a thousand years.

01:16:14.682 --> 01:16:17.173
Weakness compels strength.

01:16:22.823 --> 01:16:26.156
Betrayal begets blood.

01:16:26.327 --> 01:16:28.989
Ah!

01:16:33.934 --> 01:16:35.993
You are getting weak...

01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:38.632
...old man.

01:16:39.607 --> 01:16:41.837
Ah!

01:16:56.423 --> 01:16:57.447
Father!

01:17:15.075 --> 01:17:16.201
Move it!

01:17:34.228 --> 01:17:35.252
Shit!

01:17:40.135 --> 01:17:42.899
- What took you?
- You knew I'd come?

01:17:43.705 --> 01:17:46.367
Just because I was asleep
doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.

01:17:46.541 --> 01:17:48.475
And I forgive you.

01:17:50.011 --> 01:17:51.569
Mika!

01:17:56.885 --> 01:17:58.409
Come, this way.

01:18:18.206 --> 01:18:20.003
You swore to me
you'd stay inside the APC.

01:18:20.175 --> 01:18:22.871
- I thought we were too late.
- First team is ready, sir!

01:18:23.712 --> 01:18:25.612
- Hit it!
- Go!

01:18:33.188 --> 01:18:34.212
Stay here.

01:18:49.871 --> 01:18:50.895
You two, with me!

01:19:15.563 --> 01:19:17.428
Come, little brother.

01:19:17.599 --> 01:19:20.295
Let us play like old times.

01:19:31.212 --> 01:19:32.736
Ah!

01:19:40.055 --> 01:19:41.420
Ah!

01:20:02.444 --> 01:20:04.309
Ah!

01:20:07.282 --> 01:20:08.306
My turn.

01:20:09.084 --> 01:20:10.915
Watch the roof!

01:21:06.776 --> 01:21:08.334
Do you still think about her?

01:21:10.079 --> 01:21:13.014
Do you remember the sound she made
when I stuck her?

01:21:14.917 --> 01:21:15.975
Ah!

01:21:36.038 --> 01:21:37.505
Ugh!

01:21:44.847 --> 01:21:46.576
Ah!

01:21:47.349 --> 01:21:48.680
Ah!

01:21:54.457 --> 01:21:55.481
Watch the roof!

01:21:55.658 --> 01:21:59.856
Three o'clock!
I need a solid perimeter on the left, now!

01:22:19.181 --> 01:22:21.479
You remember...

01:22:22.218 --> 01:22:23.708
...all I taught you.

01:22:40.603 --> 01:22:44.266
You are still Ozunu.

01:22:53.382 --> 01:22:58.115
Come. Beg your father for forgiveness.

01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:09.497
Ah!

01:23:25.949 --> 01:23:27.416
Your heart is weak.

01:23:53.944 --> 01:23:55.707
Raizo!

01:24:29.746 --> 01:24:33.580
All this loss, this waste...

01:24:34.718 --> 01:24:39.052
...because you put yourself
before your family.

01:24:41.091 --> 01:24:43.753
This is not my family.

01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:49.098
You are not my father.

01:24:49.799 --> 01:24:52.597
And the breath I take after I kill you...

01:24:52.769 --> 01:24:55.033
...will be the first breath of my life.

01:26:05.543 --> 01:26:06.601
Ah!

01:26:20.257 --> 01:26:23.590
- Mika, run!
- Where is he?

01:26:23.861 --> 01:26:25.260
Where is he?

01:26:25.429 --> 01:26:27.158
Get away!

01:26:27.631 --> 01:26:29.155
Mika!

01:26:30.334 --> 01:26:31.892
No!

01:26:37.374 --> 01:26:39.342
Most children are disappointments...

01:26:40.211 --> 01:26:43.305
...not worth the effort to raise.

01:27:24.455 --> 01:27:25.820
Ah!

01:28:00.491 --> 01:28:02.049
Mika.

01:28:29.053 --> 01:28:30.884
Jesus Christ, what happened?

01:28:31.088 --> 01:28:32.749
She saved my life.

01:28:35.726 --> 01:28:36.784
Medic!

01:28:38.662 --> 01:28:40.220
Medic!

01:28:45.604 --> 01:28:47.731
She'll be all right.

01:28:48.874 --> 01:28:50.603
Her heart is special.

01:28:52.677 --> 01:28:54.645
I need a medic here now!

01:29:01.887 --> 01:29:04.287
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I don't understand.

01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:07.754
She's got a hole
right through her heart, but...

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:10.258
My heart is over here.

01:30:08.219 --> 01:30:09.686
Come with me.

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:20.972
