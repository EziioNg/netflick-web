03:46.036 --> 03:48.172
Come here.
Take a look at this.

03:50.732 --> 03:51.626
What is it?

03:51.661 --> 03:53.657
- It's a data stream from PS12.

03:54.024 --> 03:54.897
- Where is she?

03:55.163 --> 03:56.817
- Right above sector 14.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.008
There isn't anything in sector 14.

04:00.259 --> 04:01.491
There is now.

04:31.926 --> 04:33.869
- Hello?
- Miss Woods.

04:33.938 --> 04:35.385
Pleasure to speak to you.

04:35.568 --> 04:36.530
- Who is this?

04:36.654 --> 04:40.492
- My name's Maxwell Stafford.
I represent Weyland Industries.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.327
- Let me guess.
He's suing us again?

04:44.310 --> 04:45.153
- You misunderstand.

04:45.290 --> 04:49.503
Mr Weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year,

04:49.690 --> 04:50.893
if you'll meet with him.

04:51.505 --> 04:53.864
When?
Tomorrow.

04:54.655 --> 04:56.249
Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.

04:57.966 --> 04:59.945
Take me a week to get
back to the world.

05:00.246 --> 05:02.636
Yes, I told Mr Weyland that.

05:03.698 --> 05:06.385
He said he didn't have a week.

What is it, Sebastian?

06:02.969 --> 06:04.929
Early 1950'ies, would i say.

06:05.987 --> 06:08.100
Hey, Huan, we're almost there.

06:08.101 --> 06:12.708
Acording to you, the final
gift to the king...

06:12.742 --> 06:13.972
was a Pepsi.

06:14.084 --> 06:15.751
- Come again, give me one more month!
- No.

06:15.752 --> 06:18.054
- Please.
- I'll bring antother team.

06:19.286 --> 06:20.710
What?

06:21.662 --> 06:24.236
Without a crew and a permit
we're out of business.

06:24.940 --> 06:26.823
Hold the team together
for two days.

06:26.944 --> 06:29.791
I'll go to Mexico City and I'll
talk to the bank.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.619
I'll get us more money.

06:32.298 --> 06:34.899
I might be able to help you
accomplish that, Professor.

06:36.941 --> 06:37.838
Do I know you?

06:39.800 --> 06:43.013
In exchange for a little
of your time.

07:07.791 --> 07:08.757
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:09.249 --> 07:11.003
I should've switched the flash off.

07:11.482 --> 07:12.573
There's your magazine.

07:13.584 --> 07:15.157
Excuse me.
That's OK.

07:16.140 --> 07:18.189
I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
This is them.

07:18.653 --> 07:21.846
Jacob and Scotty.

07:22.632 --> 07:24.638
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.891
Just wanna show them
that their dad wasn't always so boring.

07:29.229 --> 07:30.806
- Smile.
- OK.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.232
- There you go.
- Thank you.

07:36.173 --> 07:37.239
I'm Graeme Miller.

07:37.274 --> 07:38.633
I'm a chemical engineer.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.680
Alexa Woods,
environmental technician and guide.

07:42.443 --> 07:44.231
- Do you work for Weyland?

07:44.266 --> 07:45.119
- Oh, no.

07:47.037 --> 07:49.809
No, I split my time between working
for a small environmental group

07:49.844 --> 07:52.835
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice.

07:53.299 --> 07:56.499
Lex. Buckle up.
We're gonna hit some turbulence.

07:56.534 --> 07:57.799
Thanks, Jack.

07:59.458 --> 08:00.574
- Is he a friend of yours?

08:00.609 --> 08:04.293
- Of my dad's.
He trained most of the pilots here.

08:04.328 --> 08:05.407
- Just passed the PSR.

08:05.442 --> 08:07.720
- Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.

08:08.369 --> 08:10.915
- Of what?
- The PSR.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.069
I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.227
The PSR is the point of safe return.

08:18.262 --> 08:21.442
It means we've used up half our fuel,
so we can't turn back.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.261
Right, but if something went wrong,

08:25.296 --> 08:28.731
we could land, presumably.

08:28.889 --> 08:31.108
- We could ditch.
- Yeah. Ditch.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.734
But the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes.

08:54.131 --> 08:56.546

08:57.483 --> 09:00.199
You know what? We're gonna
listen to whatever he has to say.

09:00.631 --> 09:04.408
We're not ****  polite they claime
whatever furry(?) mix.

09:05.005 --> 09:07.062
Pick the money and we
head back to Mexico.

09:07.063 --> 09:08.543
- Right.
- Right.

09:20.214 --> 09:21.239
Having fun?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.811
Yeah. That's going to fetch ya.

09:23.812 --> 09:25.412
Listen, My kids are not
going to belive this...

09:25.413 --> 09:26.413
Do you mind taking a picture?

09:27.728 --> 09:30.056
You have to hold it like that,
to the flash i lightning.

09:30.057 --> 09:30.893
You kidding.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.691
GET OF! Or wear your ass
for a hat!

09:33.692 --> 09:37.199
Okey. I'm Fucked.
Alright, okey.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.198
Nice team spirit.

09:40.448 --> 09:42.439
Keep the "beekers"(?) away
from the gear.

09:46.467 --> 09:47.943
What he means "beeka"?

09:48.282 --> 09:50.255
It's what they call scientists up here.

09:51.074 --> 09:53.046
You know "picker",
like in the muppet show.

09:53.047 --> 09:56.848
Welcome aboard, everybody. Please.

10:02.573 --> 10:05.794
Mr Weyland.

10:17.176 --> 10:19.094
Seven days ago,

10:19.162 --> 10:22.047
one of my satellites
over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits

10:22.187 --> 10:24.468
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth,

10:25.065 --> 10:27.025
which outlined this.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.009
The red lines indicate solid walls.

10:30.762 --> 10:32.030
Through thermal mapping,

10:32.065 --> 10:35.304
we've generated
a three-dimensional image of the structure.

10:36.904 --> 10:40.259
It's massive,
containing hundreds of rooms,

10:40.294 --> 10:42.729
all built around a central core.

10:43.978 --> 10:46.497
My experts tell me it's a pyramid.

10:47.977 --> 10:51.432
What they can't agree on
is who built it and when.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.734
One expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the Aztecs.

10:56.486 --> 10:58.657
Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.247
What they all agree on is that

11:00.282 --> 11:03.191
the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.

11:03.226 --> 11:04.985
- I think your experts are right.

11:05.020 --> 11:07.748
- Which one?
- All of them.

11:07.825 --> 11:09.278
- Meaning what, exactly?

11:11.498 --> 11:14.799
This pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures.

11:16.966 --> 11:19.363
This might be the first pyramid ever built.

11:19.943 --> 11:21.245
- But built by whom?

11:21.671 --> 11:23.340
- By the first civilisation.

11:26.215 --> 11:27.304
Thank you.

11:28.412 --> 11:31.502
But how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here?

11:31.537 --> 11:33.565
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.898
- It's likely the continent was once habitable.

11:37.935 --> 11:39.538
- I can't tell you who built it.

11:39.573 --> 11:43.209
But if I could take a sample from it,
I can tell you how old it is.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.290
Dr Miller, I'm offering
to put you right next to this thing.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.452
- What caused the heat bloom?

11:49.487 --> 11:50.535
- I don't know.

11:50.570 --> 11:52.518
- Where exactly on the ice is this?

11:52.884 --> 11:54.500
- Bouvetoya Island.

11:54.535 --> 11:58.278
But it's not on the ice.
It's 2,000ft below it.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.401
- Mr Quinn?

12:02.744 --> 12:05.903
- Mr Stafford.
You're looking at the best drilling team in the world.

12:06.550 --> 12:08.645
We'll chew to that depth in seven days.

12:08.646 --> 12:11.857
Add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here.

12:11.892 --> 12:14.867
We don't have that kind of time, Ms Woods.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.518
I'm not the only one
with a satellite over Antarctica.

12:18.067 --> 12:20.072
Others will be here soon.

12:20.724 --> 12:22.254
Maybe I wasn't clear.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.056
No one in this room is ready for this trip.

12:25.114 --> 12:26.806
That's why I asked you here.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.881
Bouvetoya is one of the world's
most isolated places.

12:31.055 --> 12:32.596
The nearest land is 1,000 miles away.

12:32.747 --> 12:34.163
- There's no help if we run into trouble.

12:34.305 --> 12:36.039
- You're right. It's a no-man's-land.

12:37.459 --> 12:39.253
But the train has left the station.

12:40.367 --> 12:42.775
And I think I speak
for everyone aboard this ship.

12:44.624 --> 12:46.719
This is worth the risk.

12:55.890 --> 12:58.797
Find another guide.

13:14.969 --> 13:18.460
I've spoken with Mr Weyland.
Money's been wired to your account.

13:18.955 --> 13:21.328
Chopper's refuelling to fly you home.

13:23.741 --> 13:24.899
Who'd you get?

13:27.155 --> 13:28.542
Gerald Murdoch.

13:32.490 --> 13:33.490
- Come in.

13:33.495 --> 13:36.201
- Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.
He's not ready.

13:37.324 --> 13:38.446
- Don't worry about it.

13:38.447 --> 13:40.360
- What about Paul Woodman?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.437
- We called him.
- And?

13:41.472 --> 13:43.665
- He gave the same bullshit answer you did.

13:43.974 --> 13:45.197
"Bullshit"?

13:46.707 --> 13:48.946
What I told you in there wasn't bullshit.

13:49.081 --> 13:50.862
If you rush this, people will get hurt.

13:52.193 --> 13:52.895
Maybe die.

13:53.246 --> 13:56.556
I don't understand.
We're not asking you to take us up Everest.

13:56.884 --> 13:59.658
We need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid,

13:59.693 --> 14:01.535
and back. That's it.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.082
- What about inside the pyramid?

14:03.117 --> 14:04.594
- Don't worry about that.

14:04.634 --> 14:08.103
Once we're on the site, we have the best
technology and experts

14:08.138 --> 14:09.250
that money can buy.

14:09.285 --> 14:10.794
- Is this new?
- It's the latest.

14:10.835 --> 14:15.445
Mr Weyland, when I lead my team
I don't ever leave my team.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.138
I admire your passion.

14:19.198 --> 14:22.257
I wish you were going with us.

14:22.292 --> 14:25.358
You're making a mistake.

14:31.854 --> 14:34.977
It's in the upper atmosphere.

14:35.954 --> 14:38.731
Streams of protons
and electrons from the sun

14:38.766 --> 14:43.451
being deflected by the earth's magnetic
field, causing a solar radiation storm.

14:43.725 --> 14:48.020
Shackleton called Antarctica
"the last great journey left to man".

14:48.723 --> 14:51.769
It's the one place left in the world
that no one owns.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.830
It's completely free.

14:56.221 --> 14:57.392
Me,

14:57.940 --> 15:00.008
I'm sort of partial to the penguins.

15:02.586 --> 15:06.491
I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.

15:06.609 --> 15:09.654
Come on, don't make me pull out
pictures of my kids again.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.427
Your kids aren't that cute.

15:12.465 --> 15:15.473
What if we got pictures
of other people's kids?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.495
Want my advice?

15:20.433 --> 15:22.268
Stay on the boat.

15:23.163 --> 15:24.259
OK.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.213
Let me ask you something.

15:27.204 --> 15:29.179
Do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you

15:30.305 --> 15:32.382
or with the number-two choice?

15:34.295 --> 15:37.186
Miss Woods, your helicopter's refuelled.

15:37.224 --> 15:40.270
They're waiting for you.

16:45.681 --> 16:47.241
Everybody, listen up!

16:48.234 --> 16:50.289
Gather round.

16:51.130 --> 16:52.088
Told you she'd stay.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.659
She can't resist my animal magnetism.

16:55.383 --> 16:57.501
Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.

16:57.645 --> 16:58.714
Gentlemen?

17:00.949 --> 17:03.918
It is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition,

17:04.897 --> 17:06.422
and I need your help to do that.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.066
Since I don't have time to properly train you,

17:09.206 --> 17:11.502
I'm laying down three rules.

17:11.537 --> 17:14.241
One. No one goes anywhere alone.

17:14.276 --> 17:15.454
Ever.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.529
Two:

17:18.650 --> 17:22.378
Everyone must maintain
constant communication.

17:23.220 --> 17:24.313
Three:

17:24.348 --> 17:27.634
Unexpected things are gonna happen.
When they do ...

17:28.220 --> 17:29.581
no one tries to be a hero.

17:31.114 --> 17:32.376
Understood?

17:34.793 --> 17:36.418
Understood?

17:36.453 --> 17:38.600
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

17:44.032 --> 17:47.843
Seven seasons on the ice
and I've never seen a gun save someone's life.

17:48.223 --> 17:49.639
- I don't plan on using it.

17:49.688 --> 17:50.831
- Then why bring it?

17:51.875 --> 17:53.356
Same principle as a condom.

17:54.257 --> 17:55.766
I'd rather have one and not need it

17:55.801 --> 17:58.273
than need it and not have one.

17:59.631 --> 18:02.020
I'm glad that you decided to stay.

18:04.177 --> 18:06.129
Move the trucks out on the ice.

18:24.164 --> 18:25.412
- What's with the bottle cap?

18:25.887 --> 18:26.722
What?

18:26.757 --> 18:27.988
What's with the bottle cap?

18:31.005 --> 18:34.346
This is a valuable archaeological find.

18:42.231 --> 18:44.174
When I was a kid
growing up in Italy,

18:44.677 --> 18:46.762
you know what they call a moon that big?

18:48.190 --> 18:50.547
La luna del cacciatore.

18:51.675 --> 18:54.354
La luna del cacciatore.

18:54.488 --> 18:55.350
Brava.

18:56.450 --> 18:57.533
- What's that?

18:57.733 --> 18:59.360
- Hunter's moon.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.221
Hunter's moon.

19:19.791 --> 19:20.865
Hold it, guys.

19:23.823 --> 19:25.361
- Keep those engines running!

19:25.450 --> 19:26.730
- Set it down.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.185
Move over a little further. Connors.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.852
It's an abandoned whaling station.

19:52.853 --> 19:53.853
All right, bring it up. Come on.

19:52.990 --> 19:58.021
According to your satellite imagery,
the pyramid is located directly beneath it.

20:12.022 --> 20:16.618
All right, bring it up. Come on.
Spread out.

20:17.539 --> 20:19.337
We'll use this place as a base camp.

20:19.883 --> 20:20.777
Mr Quinn,

20:20.959 --> 20:23.178
begin drilling operations as soon as you can.

20:23.331 --> 20:24.351
I'm on it.

20:24.611 --> 20:26.436
OK, guys, let's move out.

21:10.326 --> 21:11.392
- What are these?

21:11.534 --> 21:12.620
- Whale bones.

21:15.721 --> 21:18.098
This station was abandoned in 1904.

21:18.335 --> 21:20.326
Everyone just disappeared overnight.

21:21.169 --> 21:23.196
It was a big mystery back then.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.728
One for National Geographic.

23:00.750 --> 23:01.557
- Lex.

23:01.708 --> 23:04.377
- No one goes anywhere alone.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.596
There's something there. Listen. Listen.

23:15.622 --> 23:17.335
Careful. They bite.

23:29.811 --> 23:33.405
Over here. Over here.
What is it?

23:35.504 --> 23:36.807
Can you believe that?

23:46.445 --> 23:48.780
It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.

23:50.237 --> 23:51.602
- How far does it go down?

23:52.067 --> 23:53.564
- All the way to the pyramid.

23:54.714 --> 23:56.401
There it is. Clear as day.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.474
And the same time yesterday...

23:59.873 --> 24:00.848
- Nothing.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.177
- How was it done?

24:02.901 --> 24:04.608
- Thermal equipment of some kind.

24:04.783 --> 24:05.858
- Like yours?

24:07.568 --> 24:08.710
More advanced.

24:09.304 --> 24:10.829
Incredibly powerful.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.627
I've never seen anything like it.

24:15.597 --> 24:18.347
There's no team and no machine in the world

24:18.473 --> 24:20.663
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.

24:21.303 --> 24:23.179
Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure

24:23.666 --> 24:25.919
is to get down there and find out.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.030
Look at that. Change it. Now!

24:53.496 --> 24:55.244
OK, guys, what's taking so long?

24:55.245 --> 24:57.137
There's a storm coming.

25:07.241 --> 25:09.698
There's no room for sick men
on this expedition.

25:10.452 --> 25:12.001
- My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.

25:12.432 --> 25:14.698
- You're not a very good liar, Mr Weyland.

25:15.550 --> 25:18.490
Stay on the ship.
We'll update you at the top of every hour.

25:19.474 --> 25:20.656
When you get sick,

25:21.396 --> 25:23.678
you think about your life
and how you're gonna be remembered.

25:24.222 --> 25:26.177
You know what will happen when I go?

25:26.258 --> 25:29.303
Ten per cent fall in share prices.
Maybe twelve.

25:29.893 --> 25:31.112
That's it.

25:31.516 --> 25:33.263
I've heard this speech before.

25:34.712 --> 25:39.257
My dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.

25:39.405 --> 25:40.637
He was like you.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.655
He wouldn't go back or let us stop.

25:43.468 --> 25:47.257
We reached the top,
and he opened a bottle of champagne.

25:49.596 --> 25:53.630
I had my first drink with my dad
at 14,400ft.

25:55.185 --> 25:59.139
On the way down, he developed a blood clot
in his leg that travelled to his lung.

25:59.803 --> 26:03.978
He suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base.

26:05.602 --> 26:07.786
You think that's the last thing
your dad remembers?

26:08.264 --> 26:09.341
The pain?

26:10.565 --> 26:14.867
Or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?

26:18.164 --> 26:19.370
I need this.

27:16.844 --> 27:17.836
Shit.

27:23.012 --> 27:24.609
Mr Weyland!

27:24.901 --> 27:26.047
Man down!

27:27.224 --> 27:27.941
Get him!

27:27.976 --> 27:29.436
Somebody get him!

27:53.685 --> 27:55.948
Move it!
Now!

29:27.107 --> 29:27.958
I don't understand it.

29:28.943 --> 29:30.107
No equipment.

29:30.618 --> 29:32.204
No sign of another team.

29:34.799 --> 29:36.713
Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.

29:39.589 --> 29:40.490
Move it.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.022
Connors, get those lights up.

29:43.622 --> 29:45.002
We have power.

30:20.876 --> 30:23.024
Congratulations, Mr Weyland.

30:23.584 --> 30:26.133
Looks like you'll be
leaving your mark after all.

30:30.478 --> 30:31.543
Thank you.

30:32.105 --> 30:32.933
Thank you.

30:33.445 --> 30:34.974
Thank you all for this.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.839
Let's make history.

32:47.543 --> 32:48.445
Thomas.

32:50.717 --> 32:51.937
What is it?

32:54.029 --> 32:55.489
- I recognise the Egyptian...

32:55.621 --> 32:57.355
- The second symbol is Aztec.

32:57.735 --> 32:58.946
Pre-conquest era.

32:59.432 --> 33:01.139
The third is Cambodian.

33:01.448 --> 33:02.357
Then you were right.

33:02.783 --> 33:04.866
The pyramid contains
all three cultures.

33:05.263 --> 33:06.636
- That's what it looks like.

33:07.465 --> 33:09.119
You may...

33:09.225 --> 33:10.766
- "Choose

33:11.000 --> 33:12.288
to enter."

33:12.983 --> 33:15.154
"Those who choose may enter."

33:15.973 --> 33:17.383
Who taught you to translate?

33:18.364 --> 33:20.630
Funny. Kinda looked like you.

33:22.784 --> 33:25.346
Well, it's not "choose".

33:26.161 --> 33:27.660
It's "chosen".

33:28.494 --> 33:30.987
"Only the chosen ones may enter."

33:51.292 --> 33:53.228
Quinn, is that you out there?

34:39.389 --> 34:40.937
Mikkel.

36:24.111 --> 36:25.893
What is all this?

36:26.950 --> 36:29.184
This is the sacrificial chamber.

36:34.433 --> 36:36.736
Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.

36:36.989 --> 36:38.042
Whoever built this pyramid

36:38.045 --> 36:40.031
believed in ritual sacrifice.

36:42.084 --> 36:44.418
This is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods.

36:55.559 --> 36:57.836
Those that were chosen
would lie here.

36:59.298 --> 37:01.305
They weren't bound or
tied in any way.

37:02.379 --> 37:04.166
They went to die willingly.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.353
Men and women.

37:08.924 --> 37:10.692
It was considered an honour.

37:12.747 --> 37:13.782
Lucky them.

37:19.610 --> 37:20.806
Oh, god.

37:22.360 --> 37:23.811
It's incredible.

37:23.812 --> 37:27.620
The entire scull and spinal
collom removed in one piece.

37:29.304 --> 37:30.543
Look at this.

37:31.356 --> 37:33.344
Look at them.
The cleanness of the cup

37:34.495 --> 37:35.985
Straight through the bone.

37:35.986 --> 37:38.019
It's no ***** , nothing.

37:50.789 --> 37:53.438
It's probably the others,
moving trough the tunnels.

37:55.548 --> 37:56.641
Come here.

38:42.393 --> 38:44.590
Whatevet this been, it's
been dead a while.

38:44.625 --> 38:47.033
The bones are completly
calcified.

38:47.034 --> 38:48.446
No idea how long the bones
have been here...

38:48.564 --> 38:50.414
the temperature
keept it preserved.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.897
It looks like some kind of scorpion.

38:53.898 --> 38:56.969
No, climate to hostile(?)
for a scorpion.

38:57.419 --> 38:58.982
Have you seen anything like it?

39:09.376 --> 39:11.347
"They gave their lives

39:11.635 --> 39:12.664
so the hunt

39:13.086 --> 39:14.089
could begin."

39:26.052 --> 39:27.410
What happened here?

39:28.303 --> 39:31.590
It's common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim.

39:32.018 --> 39:33.128
That's nice.

39:34.238 --> 39:35.751
But that's not where your heart is.

39:38.198 --> 39:41.272
Besides, it looks like the bones
were bent straight out.

39:43.527 --> 39:45.802
Something broke out of this body.

40:39.533 --> 40:41.121
- What have you found, Max?

40:41.768 --> 40:43.613
- It's a shaft to another level.

40:45.462 --> 40:47.560
Looks like there's another
room down there.

41:13.020 --> 41:14.904
- Let's move to that lower room.

41:15.282 --> 41:16.784
- We're moving on, everyone.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.089
Ms Woods.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.137
You.

41:22.269 --> 41:25.078
Stay here. Rousseau, you stay
with him. Keep a team with you.

41:25.508 --> 41:26.867
Catalogue everything.

41:28.648 --> 41:29.948
Professor.

41:49.638 --> 41:52.491
This should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.236
Sebastian.

42:10.367 --> 42:12.122
It's a sarcophagus.

42:15.807 --> 42:17.780
This is the Long Count.

42:19.264 --> 42:21.241
This is the Aztec calendar.

42:21.829 --> 42:22.560
And this...

42:22.596 --> 42:24.712
it's some kind of
combination lock.

42:27.597 --> 42:28.686
Days.

42:30.520 --> 42:31.773
Months.

42:32.484 --> 42:33.768
Years.

42:35.596 --> 42:36.867
The dials are set for...

42:42.670 --> 42:44.460
1904.

42:45.006 --> 42:46.905
Someone opened this
100 years ago?

42:48.358 --> 42:49.277
- What's today's date?

42:49.916 --> 42:51.196
- October 10.

42:51.318 --> 42:53.789
10/10/2004.

42:56.451 --> 42:57.894
- Are you sure this is gonna work?

42:58.372 --> 42:59.285
- I don't know.

43:14.393 --> 43:15.493
Back up!

43:37.396 --> 43:38.477
Oh, my God.

43:38.512 --> 43:39.923
Take a look at this.

44:06.180 --> 44:07.518
- Any idea what these are?

44:08.100 --> 44:09.377
No.

44:09.527 --> 44:10.361
You?

44:11.200 --> 44:12.036
No.

44:12.064 --> 44:14.017
- It's a good thing we brought the experts.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.098
- Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

44:16.368 --> 44:19.409
Cos this is like finding
Moses' DVD collection.

44:25.565 --> 44:26.347
Weyland?

44:29.993 --> 44:31.858
A little too much excitement.

44:34.393 --> 44:37.836
We've been out long enough for today.
We'll set up

44:37.871 --> 44:40.662
base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning.

44:41.312 --> 44:44.900
Well, you can go back to the base camp,
Ms Woods, but we're staying here.

44:45.460 --> 44:46.360
No.

44:46.989 --> 44:48.388
You wanted to leave
without proper prep.

44:48.423 --> 44:49.175
We did.

44:49.210 --> 44:50.840
ou wanted to be the first here.

44:50.875 --> 44:51.708
We are.

44:51.901 --> 44:54.112
You've claimed the find. It's yours.

44:54.909 --> 44:57.689
Now, we move as a team,
and we're done for the day.

44:59.303 --> 45:00.475
You heard her.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.734
- What do you wanna do with these?

45:03.858 --> 45:04.689
Take them.

45:05.182 --> 45:06.837
We'll run further tests on the surface.

45:07.374 --> 45:08.636
No. No!

45:08.918 --> 45:09.899
Don't touch them.

45:25.670 --> 45:26.508
- Watch out!

45:26.948 --> 45:27.847
- The doors!

45:28.865 --> 45:29.734
- The door!

45:50.235 --> 45:51.570
- You OK?
- Yeah.

45:52.591 --> 45:53.707
Slab's gotta weigh two tons.

45:54.071 --> 45:55.398
We'll never move it.

46:38.084 --> 46:40.259
What did you say this room was called?

46:41.934 --> 46:43.712
Sacrificial chamber.

46:59.968 --> 47:01.173
Can you hear me?

47:01.208 --> 47:02.738
- Rousseau.
- Tommy, come in.

47:03.007 --> 47:04.724
- Is there anything you didn't tell me?

47:04.851 --> 47:05.652
Nothing.

47:05.687 --> 47:07.000
- Your guess is as good as mine.

47:07.276 --> 47:09.321
Whatever it is, we're not prepared.

47:09.593 --> 47:12.897
We're gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface. Let's move!

47:17.090 --> 47:18.276
- What are you doing?

47:18.531 --> 47:19.739
- My job.

47:20.474 --> 47:21.566
Yours is over.

47:21.668 --> 47:24.951
My job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely.

47:25.078 --> 47:27.049
And that gun doesn't change anything.

47:42.322 --> 47:44.533
This bearing should take us
back to the entrance.

47:44.886 --> 47:46.841
We'll regroup at the whaling station.

47:47.157 --> 47:48.993
What about Thomas? Rousseau?

47:50.025 --> 47:51.516
- We'll find them on the way up.

47:51.580 --> 47:52.580
- Max?

47:52.584 --> 47:54.711
Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.

47:55.225 --> 47:58.677
The heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now.

47:58.712 --> 47:59.708
What do you mean?

48:00.900 --> 48:03.221
A building this sophisticated
requires an energy source.

48:04.573 --> 48:06.185
I think that's what your satellite detected.

48:06.435 --> 48:08.471
A power plant for this pyramid firing up.

48:09.359 --> 48:10.369
- Preparing.

48:10.582 --> 48:12.579
- Preparing? For what?

48:12.991 --> 48:14.121
Gentlemen?

49:42.702 --> 49:43.896
Keep close.

49:56.443 --> 49:59.061
- Recognise what's on their shoulders?
- Yeah.

50:03.328 --> 50:05.072
- We worshipped these things?

50:05.380 --> 50:07.313
- According to this, we did.

50:07.722 --> 50:10.358
And the artefacts you removed from
the sarcophagus

50:11.106 --> 50:12.750
seem to be their weapons.

50:16.966 --> 50:17.817
Let's keep moving.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.814
Only another 200 yards to the entrance.

50:41.924 --> 50:42.710
Take cover.

50:42.849 --> 50:43.729
Move!

50:44.089 --> 50:45.082
Where's Stone?

50:48.861 --> 50:50.133
Stone!

51:10.628 --> 51:12.339
The pyramid's shifting again.

51:20.765 --> 51:21.873
The doors are closing.
Get out!

51:25.525 --> 51:26.436
Come on.

51:26.808 --> 51:28.230
OK. Let's go.

51:28.250 --> 51:29.050
Let's go.

51:29.113 --> 51:30.084
Let's go.

51:31.405 --> 51:32.859
Hey! Verheiden!

51:38.036 --> 51:39.678
Somebody!

51:40.116 --> 51:41.352
Run! Let's go!

52:07.348 --> 52:09.109
I hope that's son ** dead **.

52:09.396 --> 52:11.405
Didn't stop?
It's been slow?

52:11.406 --> 52:13.234
- Hey, *****.
- Inflickt(?)?

52:13.269 --> 52:14.575
- ******.
- What?

52:15.756 --> 52:18.691
I'm not a soldier, but i think
you should calm down now.

52:18.692 --> 52:20.859
Really, we're not dead yet, ok.

52:21.774 --> 52:24.283
Well, thanks, professor.

52:25.945 --> 52:30.223
Actually, it's doctor
and you be uncomfortable, okey.

52:30.224 --> 52:31.847
What?

52:48.829 --> 52:50.435
Hey! Can you hear me?

52:54.792 --> 52:56.884
It's Connors! Where are you?

53:32.738 --> 53:35.235
We're never getting
out of this place.

53:37.101 --> 53:38.167
Have you got any children?

53:40.152 --> 53:41.179
- Got a son.

53:41.220 --> 53:42.027
- Yeah, I've got two.

53:42.659 --> 53:45.456
That means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting.

53:46.164 --> 53:47.496
We're gonna make it outta here.

53:49.770 --> 53:52.886
We're surviving this if I have
to carry you the whole way.

54:00.872 --> 54:02.460
There's no way out back there.

54:07.169 --> 54:08.684
Not damaged.

54:13.002 --> 54:15.046
One of our men is dead.

54:24.830 --> 54:26.956
I need to know what
this man died for.

54:29.050 --> 54:31.324
He died trying to make(?) us.

54:34.737 --> 54:38.010
His... yours?

54:49.748 --> 54:50.840
- What's that?

54:51.172 --> 54:52.338
- Just a theory.

54:53.259 --> 54:55.204
The Aztec calendar was metric.

54:55.620 --> 54:57.277
Based on multiples of ten.

54:59.068 --> 55:02.190
I'm guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes.

55:25.611 --> 55:27.028
Let's stick together.

55:32.402 --> 55:33.561
Weyland.

55:39.152 --> 55:42.021
It would seem that

55:42.386 --> 55:44.399
we are rats in a maze.

55:48.069 --> 55:49.178
Soon(?).

56:27.457 --> 56:29.311
Connors? Connors!

56:44.742 --> 56:46.985
Verheiden? Verheiden?

56:47.325 --> 56:48.382
- Oh, God.
- Dr Miller!

56:49.448 --> 56:50.825
Get me outta here!

56:50.956 --> 56:52.909
It's OK. I'm gonna find a way
to get down to you. OK?

56:58.190 --> 56:59.167
Verheiden!

56:59.320 --> 57:00.745
No!

57:21.030 --> 57:22.384
You want a piece of me?

57:22.525 --> 57:24.900
You ugly son of a bitch!

57:37.420 --> 57:38.183
Oh, God.

58:03.843 --> 58:04.751
Weyland.

58:10.681 --> 58:13.133
Leave it.
They can only slow us down.

58:13.168 --> 58:15.873
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

58:19.508 --> 58:20.722
Give it to me.

58:39.152 --> 58:39.900
Max.

58:45.432 --> 58:46.376
Hold on.

58:46.837 --> 58:47.656
Look out!

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:27.267
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:37.011
Weyland, come on.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.899
What were they?

01:03:17.934 --> 01:03:19.702
- You tell me!
- You're the expert.

01:03:19.842 --> 01:03:20.762
I've got to stop. I've got to stop.

01:03:25.578 --> 01:03:26.447
Take it easy.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.539
Weyland.

01:03:27.574 --> 01:03:28.830
Weyland, Look at me.

01:03:28.865 --> 01:03:29.777
Look at me.

01:03:30.204 --> 01:03:32.309
You have to slow your breathing down.

01:03:32.901 --> 01:03:35.171
Slow, steady breaths.

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:41.792
- Weyland, come on.

01:03:41.827 --> 01:03:43.133
- I can hardly stand.

01:03:43.168 --> 01:03:45.372
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

01:03:45.668 --> 01:03:46.710
You didn't.

01:03:48.396 --> 01:03:49.302
- There's another one.

01:03:49.719 --> 01:03:51.208
We have to go.
Now!

01:03:51.763 --> 01:03:53.058
- Weyland.
- Come with us.

01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:55.474
- Get her outta here.
- Weyland.

01:03:55.603 --> 01:03:57.186
- Now!
- Come on.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.027
Run!

01:04:28.356 --> 01:04:30.191
Don't turn your back on me.

01:04:45.326 --> 01:04:47.043
- Wait.
- This way.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.692
- Weyland.

01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:03.385
You can't hold them.

01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:05.721
We have to go.

01:05:06.098 --> 01:05:09.358
We keep it together,
we make it to the surface.

01:05:09.842 --> 01:05:13.196
Let's go.
Let's go.

01:05:18.259 --> 01:05:20.303
<i>We keep it together,
we make it to the surface.</i>

01:05:20.338 --> 01:05:22.497
<i>We keep it together,
we make it to the surface.</i>

01:05:22.667 --> 01:05:23.716
<i>we make it to the surface.</i>

01:05:23.859 --> 01:05:24.991
We make it to the surface.

01:05:27.872 --> 01:05:28.975
Wait.

01:05:37.964 --> 01:05:39.288
This way.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.933
Go! Go!

01:07:07.896 --> 01:07:09.138
Look over here.

01:07:37.908 --> 01:07:39.557
- He's marking himself.

01:07:39.776 --> 01:07:40.773
What?

01:07:41.261 --> 01:07:45.064
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

01:07:46.087 --> 01:07:47.948
It's a rite of passage.

01:07:52.647 --> 01:07:54.665
This is starting to make sense.

01:08:03.174 --> 01:08:06.632
Think, This is a mental ritual.

01:08:08.034 --> 01:08:12.994
The humans had once...They have been
sendt here to prove their worthy,be adults

01:08:15.586 --> 01:08:17.025
You're saying they are, what?

01:08:18.935 --> 01:08:20.476
Teenagers?

01:08:24.522 --> 01:08:27.590
That's why they didn't carry
thoose guns with them.

01:08:27.591 --> 01:08:28.967
They have to earn them.

01:08:42.469 --> 01:08:45.086
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

01:08:46.134 --> 01:08:48.141
But the story is all here.

01:08:49.872 --> 01:08:51.487
Thousands of years ago,

01:08:52.705 --> 01:08:55.526
these hunters found a backwater planet.

01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:04.544
They taught humans how to build

01:09:05.825 --> 01:09:07.932
and were worshipped as gods.

01:09:12.628 --> 01:09:15.913
Every hundred years the gods would return.

01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:20.705
And when they did,

01:09:21.484 --> 01:09:23.866
they would expect a sacrifice.

01:09:24.297 --> 01:09:25.974
Humans were used to breed

01:09:26.009 --> 01:09:27.455
the ultimate prey.

01:09:36.613 --> 01:09:39.854
The hunters would battle
with these great serpents

01:09:39.889 --> 01:09:43.441
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.

01:10:00.752 --> 01:10:02.350
But if the hunters lost,

01:10:03.261 --> 01:10:05.687
they made sure nothing survived.

01:10:10.681 --> 01:10:13.444
An entire civilisation wiped out overnight.

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:21.424
So...
the humanoids, the hunters -

01:10:22.826 --> 01:10:25.041
they brought those creatures here to hunt?

01:10:25.076 --> 01:10:26.888
And they use us like cattle.

01:10:28.078 --> 01:10:30.424
We're hosts for them to breed in.

01:10:31.233 --> 01:10:34.003
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

01:10:34.752 --> 01:10:36.468
This whole thing was a trap.

01:10:38.403 --> 01:10:39.437
Without us,

01:10:39.472 --> 01:10:41.291
there could be no hunt.

01:11:11.744 --> 01:11:13.430
Verheiden!

01:11:54.448 --> 01:11:56.125
Oh, shit.

01:12:00.887 --> 01:12:02.178
When that door opens,

01:12:02.422 --> 01:12:03.679
we're dead.

01:12:04.367 --> 01:12:05.903
- Not if we set things right.

01:12:06.309 --> 01:12:07.209
- What do you mean?

01:12:07.361 --> 01:12:08.466
This pyramid

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:10.403
is like a prison.

01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.056
We took the guards' guns,

01:12:13.091 --> 01:12:15.182
and now the prisoners are running free.

01:12:15.568 --> 01:12:18.576
To restore order, the guards need their guns.

01:12:20.668 --> 01:12:21.839
When that door opens,

01:12:23.597 --> 01:12:25.279
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

01:12:25.682 --> 01:12:26.634
Are you crazy?

01:12:26.916 --> 01:12:29.231
During a big-game hunt,
the animals being hunted

01:12:29.381 --> 01:12:30.456
don't arm the hunters.

01:12:30.491 --> 01:12:31.843
They're not hunting us.

01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:34.055
We're in the middle of a war.

01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:36.864
- It's time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:42.651
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

01:12:46.026 --> 01:12:47.493
But we have to make sure

01:12:47.528 --> 01:12:50.463
those serpents don't reach the surface.

01:12:51.177 --> 01:12:52.162
Because if they do,

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.582
everything everywhere could die.

01:13:00.606 --> 01:13:02.238
The enemy of my enemy...

01:13:03.815 --> 01:13:05.015
is my friend.

01:13:28.794 --> 01:13:30.731
Let's go find our friend.

01:13:41.241 --> 01:13:43.804
How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian?

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.221
More or less.

01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:39.833
Lex.

01:14:43.728 --> 01:14:44.710
Hold on.

01:14:45.921 --> 01:14:47.291
Come on, Lex.

01:16:50.414 --> 01:16:51.988
Wait. Wait.

01:16:52.023 --> 01:16:53.009
Please, wait.

01:16:57.358 --> 01:17:00.281
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

01:19:04.285 --> 01:19:08.674
I'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

01:20:03.403 --> 01:20:05.777
What are you doing?

01:22:30.475 --> 01:22:32.071
Miller!

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.987
Miller!

01:23:33.324 --> 01:23:35.338
Sebastian.

01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:36.854
- Help me, Lex.

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.233
- I'm gonna get you out of there.

01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:39.404
- It's too late.

01:23:39.439 --> 01:23:41.896
It's inside me.
- I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:23:41.932 --> 01:23:42.640
- You can't...

01:23:42.651 --> 01:23:45.036
No. No. No! No!

01:23:46.936 --> 01:23:48.667
I have to help him.

01:23:53.035 --> 01:23:54.106
Lex!

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:56.984
They mustn't reach the surface.

01:23:57.667 --> 01:24:00.083
They mustn't reach the surface.

01:24:00.748 --> 01:24:01.745
I know.

01:24:11.274 --> 01:24:12.350
Do it!

01:24:17.823 --> 01:24:18.786
I'm sorry.

01:25:38.987 --> 01:25:40.708
It's a bomb.

01:25:41.065 --> 01:25:43.763
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.

01:26:29.331 --> 01:26:32.180
You are one ugly mother...

01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:01.330
Got it!
