Subtitles Enhanced by "Dr. Zia R Khan".
Enjoy the Movie.

00:03:10.155 --> 00:03:12.522
Hey. Hey, hey.

00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:15.008
Come here. Take a look at this.

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:18.145
What?

00:03:19.564 --> 00:03:22.498
- What is it?
- It's a data stream from PS12.

00:03:22.572 --> 00:03:26.434
- Where is she?
- Right above sector 14.

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:28.515
There isn't anything in sector 14.

00:03:28.587 --> 00:03:30.561
There is now.

00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:02.436
- Hello?
- Miss Woods. Pleasure to speak to you.

00:04:02.507 --> 00:04:04.896
- Who is this?
- My name's Maxwell Stafford.

00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:07.338
I represent Weyland lndustries.

00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:11.748
- Let me guess. He's suing us again?
- You misunderstand.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.635
Mr. Weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year, if you'll meet with him.

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:19.048
When?

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:20.576
Tomorrow.

00:04:20.682 --> 00:04:25.953
Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
Take me a week to get back to the world.

00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:29.376
Yes, I told Mr. Weyland that.

00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:31.873
He said he didn't have a week.

00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:50.817
We must be right on top of it.

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:13.194
What is it, Sebastian?

00:05:26.922 --> 00:05:30.119
The burial chamber is here.
I know it. We are gonna find it.

00:05:30.186 --> 00:05:33.863
I know it too, but without a crew
and a permit we're out of business.

00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:38.787
Hold the team together for two days.
I'll go to Mexico City and I'll talk to the bank.

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:40.898
I'll get us more money.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.864
I might be able to help you
accomplish that, Professor.

00:05:44.938 --> 00:05:47.304
Do I know you?

00:05:47.818 --> 00:05:50.981
In exchange for a little of your time.

00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:18.057
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should've switched the flash off.

00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:20.707
There's your magazine. Excuse me.

00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:22.633
That's OK.

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:25.993
I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
This is them.

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:28.425
Jacob and Scotty.

00:06:28.842 --> 00:06:31.078
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:35.335
Just wanna show them
that their dad wasn't always so boring.

00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:37.573
- Smile.
- OK.

00:06:39.466 --> 00:06:41.734
- There you go.
- Thank you.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:44.649
I'm Graeme Miller. I'm a chemical engineer.

00:06:44.713 --> 00:06:47.845
Alexa Woods,
environmental technician and guide.

00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:50.728
- Do you work for Weyland?
- Oh, no.

00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:54.884
No, I split my time between working
for a small environmental group

00:06:54.953 --> 00:06:58.182
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.598
Lex. Buckle up.
We're gonna hit some turbulence.

00:07:01.673 --> 00:07:04.041
Thanks, Jack.

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:06.527
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Of my dad's.

00:07:06.602 --> 00:07:08.674
He trained most of the pilots here.

00:07:08.745 --> 00:07:12.357
- Just passed the PSR.
- Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.

00:07:12.842 --> 00:07:15.362
- Of what?
- The PSR.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:18.946
I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.

00:07:19.017 --> 00:07:22.334
The PSR is the point of safe return.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.370
It means we've used up half our fuel,
so we can't turn back.

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:32.352
Right, but if something went wrong,
we could land, presumably.

00:07:32.425 --> 00:07:34.661
- We could ditch.
- Yeah. Ditch.

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:39.551
But the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes.

00:07:52.714 --> 00:07:55.463
Welcome aboard, everybody. Please.

00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:59.687
Some of you may be wondering
why this team has been assembled.

00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:02.306
Your host will give you the answer now.

00:08:02.377 --> 00:08:04.450
Mr. Weyland.

00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:22.408
Seven days ago, one of my satellites
over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits

00:08:22.473 --> 00:08:27.558
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth, which outlined this.

00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:30.178
The red lines indicate solid walls.

00:08:30.632 --> 00:08:36.481
Through thermal mapping, we've generated
a three-dimensional image of the structure.

00:08:36.553 --> 00:08:42.565
It's massive, containing hundreds of rooms,
all built around a central core.

00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:45.893
My experts tell me it's a pyramid.

00:08:47.177 --> 00:08:50.822
What they can't agree on
is who built it and when.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.013
One expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the Aztecs.

00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:57.667
Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:09:01.992
What they all agree on is that
the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.

00:09:02.057 --> 00:09:05.352
- I think your experts are right.
- Which one?

00:09:05.417 --> 00:09:08.832
- All of them.
- Meaning what, exactly?

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:13.893
This pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures.

00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:17.986
This might be the first pyramid ever built.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:22.498
- But built by whom?
- By the first civilization.

00:09:23.912 --> 00:09:25.735
Thank you.

00:09:25.802 --> 00:09:28.835
But how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here?

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:31.719
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.

00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:36.771
- It's likely the continent was once habitable.
- I can't tell you who built it.

00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:40.256
But if I could take a sample from it,
I can tell you how old it is.

00:09:40.328 --> 00:09:43.645
Dr. Miller, I'm offering
to put you right next to this thing.

00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:47.430
- What caused the heat bloom?
- I don't know.

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:50.813
- Where exactly on the ice is this?
- BouvetØya lsland.

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:54.631
But it's not on the ice. It's 2,000ft below it.

00:09:57.512 --> 00:10:00.099
- Mr. Quinn?
- Mr. Stafford.

00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:04.708
You're looking at the best drilling team in the
world. We'll chew to that depth in seven days.

00:10:04.777 --> 00:10:07.711
Add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here.

00:10:07.785 --> 00:10:10.720
We don't have that kind of time, Ms. Woods.

00:10:10.793 --> 00:10:13.662
I'm not the only one
with a satellite over Antarctica.

00:10:13.736 --> 00:10:15.941
Others will be here soon.

00:10:16.008 --> 00:10:20.449
Maybe I wasn't clear.
No one in this room is ready for this trip.

00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:22.790
That's why I asked you here.

00:10:22.856 --> 00:10:27.558
BouvetØya is one of the world's most isolated
places. The nearest land is 1,000 miles away.

00:10:27.624 --> 00:10:32.033
- There's no help if we run into trouble.
- You're right. It's a no-man's-land.

00:10:32.104 --> 00:10:34.887
But the train has left the station.

00:10:34.953 --> 00:10:38.946
And I think I speak
for everyone aboard this ship.

00:10:39.017 --> 00:10:40.926
This is worth the risk.

00:10:49.897 --> 00:10:52.449
Find another guide.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.906
I've spoken with Mr. Weyland.
Money's been wired to your account.

00:11:11.976 --> 00:11:15.140
Chopper's refueling to fly you home.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.749
Who'd you get?

00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:21.955
Gerald Murdoch.

00:11:25.416 --> 00:11:27.750
- Come in.
- Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.

00:11:27.816 --> 00:11:29.639
He's not ready.

00:11:29.704 --> 00:11:32.552
- Don't worry about it.
- What about Paul Woodman?

00:11:32.617 --> 00:11:35.748
- We called him.
- He gave the same bullshit answer you did.

00:11:35.816 --> 00:11:37.245
"Bullshit"?

00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:44.766
What I told you in there wasn't bullshit. If you
rush this, people will get hurt. Maybe die.

00:11:44.841 --> 00:11:48.418
I don't understand.
We're not asking you to take us up Everest.

00:11:48.488 --> 00:11:52.285
We need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid, and back. That's it.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.459
- What about inside the pyramid?
- Don't worry about that.

00:11:55.528 --> 00:11:59.751
Once we're on the site, we have the best
technology and experts that money can buy.

00:11:59.816 --> 00:12:01.725
- Is this new?
- It's the latest.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:06.534
Mr. Weyland, when I lead my team
I don't ever leave my team.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.705
I admire your passion.

00:12:09.609 --> 00:12:12.707
I wish you were going with us.

00:12:12.776 --> 00:12:14.848
You're making a mistake.

00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:24.829
It's in the upper atmosphere.

00:12:25.736 --> 00:12:28.419
Streams of protons
and electrons from the sun

00:12:28.488 --> 00:12:32.896
being deflected by the earth's magnetic
field, causing a solar radiation storm.

00:12:32.967 --> 00:12:37.605
Shackleton called Antarctica
"the last great journey left to man".

00:12:38.056 --> 00:12:41.471
It's the one place left in the world
that no one owns.

00:12:41.544 --> 00:12:43.584
It's completely free.

00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:48.993
Me, I'm sort of partial to the penguins.

00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:55.359
I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.

00:12:55.432 --> 00:12:59.523
Come on, don't make me pull out
pictures of my kids again.

00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:01.599
Your kids aren't that cute.

00:13:01.671 --> 00:13:05.698
What if we got pictures
of other people's kids?

00:13:05.768 --> 00:13:08.321
Want my advice?

00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:11.043
Stay on the boat.

00:13:11.112 --> 00:13:14.407
OK. Let me ask you something.

00:13:14.952 --> 00:13:17.854
Do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:21.276
or with the number-two choice?

00:13:22.152 --> 00:13:24.934
Miss Woods, your helicopter's refueled.

00:13:24.999 --> 00:13:27.618
They're waiting for you.

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:32.609
Everybody, listen up!

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:34.851
Gather round.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.422
Told you she'd stay.
She can't resist my animal magnetism.

00:14:39.527 --> 00:14:41.666
Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:43.296
Gentlemen?

00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:48.548
It is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition,

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:50.820
and I need your help to do that.

00:14:50.888 --> 00:14:55.078
Since I don't have time to properly train you,
I'm laying down three rules.

00:14:55.143 --> 00:14:59.584
One. No one goes anywhere alone, ever.

00:14:59.656 --> 00:15:01.761
Two.

00:15:01.831 --> 00:15:06.371
Everyone must maintain
constant communication.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.756
Three. Unexpected things are gonna happen.

00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:12.963
When they do, no one tries to be a hero.

00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:16.100
Understood?

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.006
Understood?

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.568
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

00:15:26.088 --> 00:15:30.016
Seven seasons on the ice
and I've never seen a gun save someone's life.

00:15:30.088 --> 00:15:33.666
- I don't plan on using it.
- Then why bring it?

00:15:33.736 --> 00:15:35.841
Same principle as a condom.

00:15:35.911 --> 00:15:40.286
I'd rather have one and not need it
than need it and not have one.

00:15:41.062 --> 00:15:43.484
I'm glad that you decided to stay.

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:48.642
Move the trucks out on the ice.

00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:51.460
Move that. OK, let's move.

00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:07.109
- What's with the bottle cap?
- What?

00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.893
What's with the bottle cap?

00:16:11.431 --> 00:16:14.594
This is a valuable archaeological find.

00:16:21.991 --> 00:16:27.293
When I was a kid growing up in ltaly,
you know what they call a moon that big?

00:16:27.783 --> 00:16:29.921
La luna del cacciatore.

00:16:33.798 --> 00:16:35.621
Brava.

00:16:35.686 --> 00:16:38.685
- What's that?
- Hunter's moon.

00:16:39.078 --> 00:16:41.412
Hunter's moon.

00:16:58.055 --> 00:17:00.421
Hold it, guys.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:06.147
- Keep those engines running!
- Set it down.

00:17:06.214 --> 00:17:09.531
Move over a little further. Connors.

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.085
It's an abandoned whaling station.

00:17:29.158 --> 00:17:34.908
According to your satellite imagery,
the pyramid is located directly beneath it.

00:17:47.846 --> 00:17:50.977
All right, bring it up. Come on.

00:17:51.046 --> 00:17:53.664
Spread out.

00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:55.709
We'll use this place as a base camp.

00:17:55.782 --> 00:17:58.847
Mr. Quinn, begin drilling operations
as soon as you can.

00:17:58.918 --> 00:18:01.984
I'm on it. OK, guys, let's move out.

00:18:43.973 --> 00:18:46.559
- What are these?
- Whale bones.

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:54.363
This station was abandoned in 1904.
Everyone just disappeared overnight.

00:18:54.437 --> 00:18:57.284
It was a big mystery back then.

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.132
One for National Geographic.

00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:33.698
- Lex.
- No one goes anywhere alone.

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:37.693
There's something there. Listen. Listen.

00:20:44.068 --> 00:20:46.240
Careful. They bite.

00:20:57.829 --> 00:21:00.098
Over here. Over here.

00:21:00.165 --> 00:21:01.856
What is it?

00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:05.436
Can you believe that?

00:21:13.732 --> 00:21:17.443
It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.700
- How far does it go down?
- All the way to the pyramid.

00:21:21.765 --> 00:21:25.562
There it is. Clear as day.
And the same time yesterday...

00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:29.502
- Nothing.
- How was it done?

00:21:29.573 --> 00:21:34.308
- Thermal equipment of some kind.
- Like yours?

00:21:34.374 --> 00:21:36.991
More advanced. Incredibly powerful.

00:21:39.396 --> 00:21:41.917
I've never seen anything like it.

00:21:41.988 --> 00:21:47.139
There's no team and no machine in the world
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:51.548
Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure
is to get down there and find out.

00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:16.836
Look at that. Change it. Now!

00:22:17.796 --> 00:22:21.855
OK, guys, what's taking so long?
There's a storm coming.

00:22:31.077 --> 00:22:34.338
There's no room for sick men
on this expedition.

00:22:34.405 --> 00:22:39.042
- My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.
- You're not a very good liar, Mr. Weyland.

00:22:39.109 --> 00:22:42.884
Stay on the ship.
We'll update you at the top of every hour.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.684
When you get sick, you think about your life
and how you're gonna be remembered.

00:22:47.749 --> 00:22:51.458
You know what will happen when I go?
Ten per cent fall in share prices.

00:22:51.525 --> 00:22:53.892
Maybe 12. That's it.

00:22:54.725 --> 00:22:57.573
I've heard this speech before.

00:22:57.637 --> 00:23:01.859
My dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.

00:23:02.469 --> 00:23:06.046
He was like you.
He wouldn't go back or let us stop.

00:23:06.117 --> 00:23:10.012
We reached the top,
and he opened a bottle of champagne.

00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:15.803
I had my first drink with my dad at 14,400ft.

00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:21.597
On the way down, he developed a blood clot
in his leg that traveled to his lung.

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:26.011
He suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base.

00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:31.489
You think that's the last thing
your dad remembers? The pain?

00:23:31.972 --> 00:23:37.602
Or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?

00:23:39.396 --> 00:23:40.956
I need this.

00:23:49.477 --> 00:23:51.714
Come on, move.

00:24:35.684 --> 00:24:37.058
Shit.

00:24:41.604 --> 00:24:43.360
Mr. Weyland!

00:24:43.428 --> 00:24:45.599
Man down!

00:24:45.668 --> 00:24:48.418
Get him! Somebody get him!

00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:12.060
Move it!

00:25:12.133 --> 00:25:13.823
Now!

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.635
I don't understand it.
No equipment. No sign of another team.

00:26:47.748 --> 00:26:50.814
Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.

00:26:52.516 --> 00:26:56.345
Move it. Connors, get those lights up.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.591
We have power.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.458
Congratulations, Mr. Weyland.

00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:38.622
Looks like you'll be
leaving your mark after all.

00:27:41.091 --> 00:27:43.938
Thank you. Thank you.

00:27:44.002 --> 00:27:46.336
Thank you all for this.

00:27:47.778 --> 00:27:49.949
Let's make history.

00:29:52.675 --> 00:29:54.780
Thomas.

00:29:55.714 --> 00:29:57.721
What is it?

00:29:58.849 --> 00:30:02.363
- I recognize the Egyptian...
- The second symbol is Aztec.

00:30:02.434 --> 00:30:05.849
Pre-conquest era. The third is Cambodian.

00:30:05.922 --> 00:30:09.599
Then you were right.
The pyramid contains all three cultures.

00:30:09.666 --> 00:30:16.157
- That's what it looks like.
- "You may choose to enter."

00:30:17.058 --> 00:30:19.840
"Those who choose may enter."

00:30:19.906 --> 00:30:22.044
Who taught you to translate?

00:30:22.114 --> 00:30:25.212
Funny. Kinda looked like you.

00:30:26.306 --> 00:30:29.568
Well, it's not "choose".

00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:31.423
It's "chosen".

00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:34.460
"Only the chosen ones may enter."

00:30:53.698 --> 00:30:57.113
Quinn, is that you out there?

00:31:38.945 --> 00:31:40.571
Mikkel.

00:33:19.554 --> 00:33:21.920
What is all this?

00:33:21.985 --> 00:33:25.564
This is the sacrificial chamber.

00:33:29.089 --> 00:33:31.609
Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.

00:33:31.681 --> 00:33:36.503
Whoever built this pyramid
believed in ritual sacrifice.

00:33:36.577 --> 00:33:40.887
This is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods.

00:33:49.633 --> 00:33:52.950
Those that were chosen would lie here.

00:33:53.025 --> 00:33:55.513
They weren't bound or tied in any way.

00:33:56.033 --> 00:33:58.586
They went to die willingly.

00:33:58.657 --> 00:34:00.631
Men and women.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:04.827
It was considered an honor.

00:34:05.889 --> 00:34:08.475
Lucky them.

00:34:17.986 --> 00:34:22.906
"They gave their lives
so the hunt could begin."

00:34:34.146 --> 00:34:36.054
What happened here?

00:34:36.129 --> 00:34:39.577
It's common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim.

00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:41.885
That's nice.

00:34:41.952 --> 00:34:44.822
But that's not where your heart is.

00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:49.754
Besides, it looks like the bones
were bent straight out.

00:34:51.264 --> 00:34:54.364
Something broke out of this body.

00:35:44.929 --> 00:35:49.883
- What have you found, Max?
- It's a shaft to another level.

00:35:50.433 --> 00:35:53.466
Looks like there's another room down there.

00:36:15.169 --> 00:36:19.805
- Let's move to that lower room.
- We're moving on, everyone.

00:36:19.872 --> 00:36:22.207
Ms. Woods.

00:36:23.393 --> 00:36:26.939
You, stay here. Rousseau, you stay with him.
Keep a team with you.

00:36:27.009 --> 00:36:28.764
Catalogue everything.

00:36:30.465 --> 00:36:31.926
Professor.

00:36:50.496 --> 00:36:55.068
This should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber.

00:37:02.049 --> 00:37:04.121
Sebastian.

00:37:10.177 --> 00:37:12.926
It's a sarcophagus.

00:37:15.264 --> 00:37:17.501
This is the Long Count.

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:21.183
This is the Aztec calendar.

00:37:21.249 --> 00:37:25.046
And this, it's some kind of combination lock.

00:37:26.721 --> 00:37:28.694
"Days."

00:37:29.536 --> 00:37:31.358
"Months."

00:37:31.424 --> 00:37:33.432
"Years."

00:37:34.112 --> 00:37:36.447
The dials are set for...

00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:43.455
1904.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.942
Someone opened this 100 years ago?

00:37:46.657 --> 00:37:49.472
- What's today's date?
- October 10.

00:37:49.537 --> 00:37:52.057
10/10/2004.

00:37:54.464 --> 00:37:58.773
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- I don't know.

00:38:11.712 --> 00:38:13.915
Back up!

00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:36.376
Oh, my God. Take a look at this.

00:39:01.342 --> 00:39:04.604
- Any idea what these are?
- No.

00:39:04.702 --> 00:39:06.874
- You?
- No.

00:39:06.943 --> 00:39:10.970
- It's a good thing we brought the experts.
- Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:14.520
'Cause this is like finding
Moses' DVD collection.

00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:21.627
Weyland?

00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:26.714
A little too much excitement.

00:39:28.351 --> 00:39:30.522
We've been out long enough for today.

00:39:30.591 --> 00:39:34.847
We'll set up base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning.

00:39:34.911 --> 00:39:39.002
Well, you can go back to the base camp,
Ms. Woods, but we're staying here.

00:39:39.071 --> 00:39:42.616
No. You wanted to leave
without proper prep. We did.

00:39:42.686 --> 00:39:47.957
You wanted to be the first here. We are.
You've claimed the find. It's yours.

00:39:48.031 --> 00:39:52.056
Now, we move as a team,
and we're done for the day.

00:39:52.126 --> 00:39:54.330
You heard her.

00:39:55.007 --> 00:39:57.689
- What do you wanna do with these?
- Take them.

00:39:57.759 --> 00:39:59.832
We'll run further tests on the surface.

00:39:59.902 --> 00:40:02.652
No. No! Don't touch them.

00:40:17.503 --> 00:40:20.405
- Watch out!
- The doors!

00:40:20.479 --> 00:40:22.584
The door!

00:40:41.054 --> 00:40:42.909
- You OK?
- Yeah.

00:40:43.454 --> 00:40:47.611
Slab's gotta weigh two tons.
We'll never move it.

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:29.912
What did you say this room was called?

00:41:30.814 --> 00:41:33.181
Sacrificial chamber.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.012
- Rousseau.
- Tommy, come in.

00:41:49.087 --> 00:41:50.810
- Come in, Rousseau.
- Come in.

00:41:50.878 --> 00:41:54.970
- Is there anything you didn't tell me?
- Nothing. Your guess is as good as mine.

00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:57.340
Whatever it is, we're not prepared.

00:41:57.406 --> 00:42:01.629
We're gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface. Let's move!

00:42:04.479 --> 00:42:08.734
- What are you doing?
- My job. Yours is over.

00:42:08.798 --> 00:42:12.027
My job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely.

00:42:12.094 --> 00:42:15.323
And that gun doesn't change anything.

00:42:28.606 --> 00:42:33.014
This bearing should take us back to the
entrance. We'll regroup at the whaling station.

00:42:33.086 --> 00:42:35.901
What about Thomas? Rousseau?

00:42:35.966 --> 00:42:38.454
- We'll find them on the way up.
- Max?

00:42:38.526 --> 00:42:40.861
Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.

00:42:40.927 --> 00:42:44.439
The heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.266
What do you mean?

00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:49.595
A building this sophisticated
requires an energy source.

00:42:49.663 --> 00:42:54.714
I think that's what your satellite detected.
A power plant for this pyramid firing up.

00:42:54.782 --> 00:42:57.684
- Preparing.
- Preparing? For what?

00:42:57.758 --> 00:42:59.764
Gentlemen?

00:44:09.694 --> 00:44:11.669
Keep close.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:27.030
- Recognize what's on their shoulders?
- Yeah.

00:44:29.534 --> 00:44:33.624
- We worshipped these things?
- According to this, we did.

00:44:33.694 --> 00:44:39.607
And the artifacts you removed from
the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons.

00:44:42.557 --> 00:44:47.445
Let's keep moving.
Only another 200 yards to the entrance.

00:45:06.205 --> 00:45:08.410
Take cover.

00:45:08.477 --> 00:45:09.938
Where's Stone?

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.840
Stone!

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.437
The pyramid's shifting again.

00:45:43.678 --> 00:45:46.361
The doors are closing. Get out.

00:45:48.477 --> 00:45:49.557
Come on.

00:45:49.629 --> 00:45:50.840
OK. Let's go.

00:45:50.909 --> 00:45:52.851
Let's go. Let's go.

00:45:54.205 --> 00:45:55.798
Hey! Verheiden!

00:45:55.869 --> 00:45:57.080
Verheiden!

00:45:57.693 --> 00:45:59.897
Verheiden!

00:46:00.445 --> 00:46:02.137
Somebody!

00:46:02.206 --> 00:46:04.441
Run! Let's go!

00:46:04.509 --> 00:46:06.003
No!

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:08.051
Quickly!

00:46:08.125 --> 00:46:11.322
No! No!

00:46:40.572 --> 00:46:43.060
Hey! Can you hear me?

00:46:47.005 --> 00:46:49.656
It's Connors! Where are you?

00:47:11.709 --> 00:47:14.840
We're never getting out of this place.

00:47:15.613 --> 00:47:17.686
Have you got any children?

00:47:18.524 --> 00:47:20.664
- Got a son.
- Yeah, I've got two.

00:47:20.734 --> 00:47:24.029
That means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting.

00:47:24.093 --> 00:47:26.744
We're gonna make it outta here.

00:47:27.677 --> 00:47:32.630
We're surviving this
if I have to carry you the whole way.

00:47:38.333 --> 00:47:40.700
There's no way out back there.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.079
- What's that?
- Just a theory.

00:47:45.148 --> 00:47:49.403
The Aztec calendar was metric.
Based on multiples of ten.

00:47:50.621 --> 00:47:54.931
I'm guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes.

00:48:16.157 --> 00:48:18.939
Let's stick together.

00:48:22.717 --> 00:48:24.539
Weyland.

00:48:29.085 --> 00:48:34.420
It would seem that we are rats in a maze.

00:48:37.725 --> 00:48:39.285
Sorry.

00:49:15.515 --> 00:49:17.905
Connors? Connors!

00:49:31.963 --> 00:49:34.418
Verheiden? Verheiden?

00:49:34.524 --> 00:49:37.688
- Oh, God.
- Dr. Miller! Get me outta here!

00:49:37.756 --> 00:49:41.433
It's OK. I'm gonna find a way
to get down to you. OK?

00:49:44.828 --> 00:49:46.038
Verheiden!

00:49:46.107 --> 00:49:47.863
No!

00:50:06.683 --> 00:50:10.961
You want a piece of me?
You ugly son of a bitch!

00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:23.760
Oh, God.

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.072
Weyland.

00:50:49.147 --> 00:50:52.344
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:50:54.459 --> 00:50:56.915
Leave it. They can only slow us down.

00:50:56.987 --> 00:51:00.849
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

00:51:02.907 --> 00:51:04.882
Give it to me.

00:51:21.787 --> 00:51:24.722
Max.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.045
Hold on.

00:51:29.115 --> 00:51:31.155
Look out!

00:53:03.066 --> 00:53:05.717
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

00:53:13.083 --> 00:53:15.090
Weyland, come on.

00:55:47.386 --> 00:55:49.939
- What were they?
- You're the expert.

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.857
I've got to stop. I've got to stop.

00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:58.359
Take it easy. Weyland.

00:55:58.426 --> 00:55:59.986
Look at me.

00:56:00.057 --> 00:56:02.578
You have to slow your breathing down.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:04.985
Slow, steady breaths.

00:56:10.362 --> 00:56:12.631
- Weyland, come on.
- I can hardly stand.

00:56:12.698 --> 00:56:14.935
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

00:56:15.002 --> 00:56:17.424
You didn't.

00:56:17.498 --> 00:56:21.360
- There's another one. We have to go. Now!
- Weyland.

00:56:21.434 --> 00:56:24.216
- Come with us.
- Get her outta here.

00:56:24.282 --> 00:56:26.737
- Now!
- Come on.

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:29.298
Run!

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:58.544
Don't turn your back on me.

00:57:25.402 --> 00:57:26.645
Wait.

00:57:34.809 --> 00:57:36.271
This way.

00:57:41.882 --> 00:57:44.784
Go! Go!

00:59:01.082 --> 00:59:03.057
Look over here.

00:59:29.784 --> 00:59:32.882
- He's marking himself.
- What?

00:59:32.952 --> 00:59:37.425
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

00:59:37.496 --> 00:59:39.668
It's a rite of passage.

00:59:44.056 --> 00:59:46.707
This is starting to make sense.

00:59:55.064 --> 00:59:59.025
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

00:59:59.095 --> 01:00:01.779
But the story is all here.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:10.736
Thousands of years ago,
these hunters found a backwater planet.

01:00:17.465 --> 01:00:22.679
They taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods.

01:00:27.032 --> 01:00:30.741
Every hundred years the gods would return.

01:00:33.304 --> 01:00:37.679
And when they did,
they would expect a sacrifice.

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.808
Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.

01:00:50.008 --> 01:00:53.357
The hunters would battle
with these great serpents

01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:57.109
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.

01:01:13.144 --> 01:01:15.566
But if the hunters lost,

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.454
they made sure nothing survived.

01:01:22.776 --> 01:01:26.605
An entire civilization wiped out overnight.

01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:30.485
So...

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:36.727
the humanoids, the hunters -
they brought those creatures here to hunt?

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:38.799
And they use us like cattle.

01:01:39.639 --> 01:01:42.487
We're hosts for them to breed in.

01:01:42.552 --> 01:01:45.847
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

01:01:45.945 --> 01:01:48.661
This whole thing was a trap.

01:01:49.528 --> 01:01:52.146
Without us, there could be no hunt.

01:02:20.055 --> 01:02:21.582
Shit!

01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:23.630
Verheiden!

01:03:02.744 --> 01:03:03.954
Oh, shit.

01:03:08.663 --> 01:03:11.860
When that door opens, we're dead.

01:03:11.928 --> 01:03:14.830
- Not if we set things right.
- What do you mean?

01:03:14.904 --> 01:03:17.903
This pyramid is like a prison.

01:03:18.935 --> 01:03:22.547
We took the guards' guns,
and now the prisoners are running free.

01:03:22.615 --> 01:03:25.964
To restore order, the guards need their guns.

01:03:27.575 --> 01:03:32.397
When that door opens,
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

01:03:32.471 --> 01:03:37.075
Are you crazy? During a big-game hunt, the
animals being hunted don't arm the hunters.

01:03:37.144 --> 01:03:40.526
They're not hunting us.
We're in the middle of a war.

01:03:40.598 --> 01:03:44.112
- It's time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.

01:03:45.047 --> 01:03:50.710
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

01:03:51.736 --> 01:03:56.111
But we have to make sure
those serpents don't reach the surface.

01:03:56.759 --> 01:03:59.029
Because if they do,

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:02.028
everything everywhere could die.

01:04:05.815 --> 01:04:07.789
The enemy of my enemy...

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:10.894
is my friend.

01:04:32.919 --> 01:04:35.374
Let's go find our friend.

01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:47.474
How do you say "scared shitless" in ltalian?

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:52.365
Non vedo l'ora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.741
More or less.

01:05:15.767 --> 01:05:17.294
Move!

01:05:39.831 --> 01:05:41.391
Lex.

01:05:43.478 --> 01:05:44.885
Lex.

01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:46.445
Hold on.

01:05:46.871 --> 01:05:48.594
Come on, Lex.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:55.793
Oh, no.

01:07:46.487 --> 01:07:48.821
Wait. Wait. Please, wait.

01:07:52.663 --> 01:07:55.729
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

01:07:58.134 --> 01:08:00.435
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

01:09:56.309 --> 01:10:00.565
I'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:47.471
What are you doing?

01:12:51.829 --> 01:12:53.836
Miller!

01:13:02.036 --> 01:13:03.859
Miller!

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.296
Sebastian.

01:13:54.164 --> 01:13:56.914
- Help me, Lex.
- I'm gonna get you out of there.

01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:00.558
- It's too late. It's inside me.
- I'm gonna get you outta here.

01:14:00.628 --> 01:14:02.799
- You can't...
- No!

01:14:02.869 --> 01:14:05.716
No. No. No! No!

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:07.787
I have to help him.

01:14:10.931 --> 01:14:12.655
Lex!

01:14:12.723 --> 01:14:15.145
They mustn't reach the surface.

01:14:15.507 --> 01:14:18.322
They mustn't reach the surface.

01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:20.809
I know.

01:14:28.436 --> 01:14:30.444
Do it!

01:14:33.908 --> 01:14:35.915
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:52.563 --> 01:15:54.832
It's a bomb.

01:15:54.899 --> 01:15:57.071
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.

01:16:40.852 --> 01:16:43.721
You are one ugly mother...

01:21:58.097 --> 01:21:59.755
Got it!

01:26:22.097 --> 01:26:38.555
