01:37.681 --> 01:39.432
Who are you?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.611
What is this?

02:33.779 --> 02:37.281
Your Majesty, caught him up
in a fishing net. A fishing net.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.367
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...

02:39.535 --> 02:41.410
We believe he's found a...

02:49.419 --> 02:51.337
Ponce de León.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.800
Says he found
Ponce de León's ship.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.678
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

02:58.846 --> 03:01.097
Ponce de León died 200 years ago.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.767
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

03:07.479 --> 03:09.188
The Fountain of Youth.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.070
How soon can you sail?

03:17.406 --> 03:19.490
With the tide.

03:37.593 --> 03:38.759
Over here!
Lucky heather!

03:40.012 --> 03:41.971
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

03:42.139 --> 03:45.516
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!

03:45.684 --> 03:47.518
Pirate puppets!

03:48.186 --> 03:49.186
Take that, you!

03:49.354 --> 03:51.147
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!

03:51.315 --> 03:54.984
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.777
Pirate hanging today!

03:58.739 --> 04:01.616
Come on. Up you get.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.493
Move along, pirate.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.039
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.418
Come on. Come on! Up you go.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.420
Quiet! Order!

04:15.923 --> 04:17.298
Quiet!

04:18.133 --> 04:19.884
Now appearing before the court,

04:20.052 --> 04:23.262
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

04:23.430 --> 04:24.805
- and highwayman...
- Quiet!

04:24.973 --> 04:26.641
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

04:30.896 --> 04:34.398
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!

04:34.566 --> 04:36.359
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!

04:36.526 --> 04:37.818
Presiding over these trials,

04:37.986 --> 04:43.574
all rise and attend,
the Right Honorable Justice Smith!

04:53.251 --> 04:55.127
My dear sir.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.049
Quiet!

05:01.718 --> 05:03.678
Now...

05:05.097 --> 05:07.056
...what do we have here?

05:07.224 --> 05:08.516
Jack?

05:08.684 --> 05:10.142
Shut up!

05:11.019 --> 05:11.936
I don't recognize him.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.272
Not necessary. You were saying?

05:15.440 --> 05:18.067
Jack Sparrow is not my name.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.111
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.988
Is that so?

05:22.155 --> 05:25.157
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.452
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court

05:28.620 --> 05:31.497
- if it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense,

05:31.665 --> 05:34.333
unless you want to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.628
The prisoner claims of being innocent

05:37.796 --> 05:40.172
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

05:41.049 --> 05:43.050
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

05:43.218 --> 05:45.720
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.722
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.559
Hang him! String him up!

05:54.354 --> 05:56.355
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!

05:56.523 --> 05:57.732
Shut it.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.778
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime ofwhich
you've been found guilty of

06:02.946 --> 06:05.656
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.200
I hereby commute your sentence,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.995
and order that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

06:11.163 --> 06:13.998
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.083
- What?!
- Hang him!

06:16.251 --> 06:17.418
- Hang him!
- There.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.921
- Balderdash!
- String him up! Hang him high!

06:22.591 --> 06:25.217
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

06:25.385 --> 06:27.386
to the Tower of London.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.191
Thanks very much.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.780
Ta.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.203
Come on. Get up there.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.332
Get up!

07:01.046 --> 07:04.673
Hell's teeth.
Now we're both headed for prison.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.510
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.

07:07.677 --> 07:11.013
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.681
Tonight, we make the coast.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.184
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.105
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.190
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

07:21.358 --> 07:24.485
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs
from one appointment with the gallows.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.403
Seeing as how you're still alive,

07:26.571 --> 07:29.281
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.158
What happened to you, Gibbs?

07:31.326 --> 07:33.869
I thought you were employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.498
Aye. But I always listened like a thief
for news of the Black Pearl.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.084
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.294
Then, I hear a rumor:

07:42.462 --> 07:45.923
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and looking for a crew.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.800
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.177
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.846
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.

07:52.013 --> 07:55.224
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

07:55.392 --> 07:59.061
but then, you've never been
the most predictable of sorts.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.230
Tell me something.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.900
There is another Jack Sparrow out there
sullying my good name?

08:05.068 --> 08:07.194
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

08:07.362 --> 08:11.073
But... an impostor with a ship.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.784
And in need of a crew.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.953
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.581
What about you, Jack?

08:18.748 --> 08:22.585
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.253
Any luck?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.258
Circumstances arose
and forced a compelling insight

08:29.426 --> 08:31.385
regarding discretion and valor.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.638
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.600
I am just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

08:37.767 --> 08:42.563
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.358
Short trip.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.329
All part of the plan, yes?

09:01.499 --> 09:02.541
No.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.049
You are Jack Sparrow?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.760
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.430
I've heard of you.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.640
And you know who I am.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.227
Face is familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

10:45.395 --> 10:49.148
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,

10:49.316 --> 10:52.151
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

10:52.319 --> 10:55.696
King of Great Britain and Ireland,
and of you.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.533
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

10:59.701 --> 11:04.121
you have come to London
to procure a crew for your ship.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.415
Vicious rumor. Not true.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.668
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.047
I am Jack Sparrow,
but I'm not here to procure a crew.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.591
That is... someone else.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.304
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.223
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.643
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.854
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.398
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.233
And I am in London.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.444
To procure a crew.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.279
To undertake a voyage

11:37.447 --> 11:38.864
- to the Fountain...
- What?

11:39.032 --> 11:43.577
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

11:43.745 --> 11:44.870
Come, come.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.750
We know you're in possession of a map.

11:49.918 --> 11:53.045
So confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him!

11:53.213 --> 11:55.047
Have you a map?

12:00.428 --> 12:02.429
- No.
- Where is it?

12:02.597 --> 12:06.266
The truth? I lost it.

12:06.434 --> 12:10.396
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.149
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

12:14.317 --> 12:19.405
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

12:19.572 --> 12:24.159
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

12:26.287 --> 12:28.664
You do know the way to the Fountain?

12:28.832 --> 12:30.958
Of course I do.
Look at me.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.960
You could guide an expedition.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.631
With your permission, your heinie,

12:37.799 --> 12:40.175
you will be providing, then, a ship...

12:42.095 --> 12:43.429
...and a crew?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.098
And a captain.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.949
Afternoon, sire.

13:05.493 --> 13:09.329
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not in chains?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.373
He must be manacled at once.

13:11.541 --> 13:15.127
At the center of my palace? Hardly.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.421
Hector.

13:17.589 --> 13:21.049
How nice to see a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.344
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

13:24.512 --> 13:30.058
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.687
As may be, but first,

13:33.855 --> 13:36.023
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

13:36.191 --> 13:39.276
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.695
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

13:41.863 --> 13:45.741
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.876
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

13:56.044 --> 14:01.298
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.885
I have every confidence
you will prevail and be rewarded

14:05.053 --> 14:07.346
with the high station you so desire.

14:07.514 --> 14:12.267
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.729
Jack, our sands be all but run.

14:15.897 --> 14:19.191
Where's the harm
in joining the winning side?

14:19.359 --> 14:23.111
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.656
I understand everything.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.367
Except that wig.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.834
He's getting away!
Stop him!

14:38.002 --> 14:41.588
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!

15:03.570 --> 15:04.570
Come down!

15:14.831 --> 15:18.250
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.092
Guards! Guards!

15:49.949 --> 15:52.367
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!

15:59.334 --> 16:00.834
Find him!

16:22.815 --> 16:24.566
Finders keepers!

16:24.734 --> 16:25.942
There!

16:49.467 --> 16:50.759
Is that it?

16:55.139 --> 16:57.432
Halt! Stop that carriage!

16:57.600 --> 16:58.850
Head him off!

17:07.902 --> 17:09.486
Out of the way!

17:36.347 --> 17:38.515
Stop that pirate!

17:40.685 --> 17:42.227
Move out of the way!

17:48.985 --> 17:50.193
Stop that man!

17:51.654 --> 17:52.863
Don't let him get away!

18:00.747 --> 18:02.122
Fire!

18:30.902 --> 18:33.737
He's getting away!
After him! Stop him!

18:36.866 --> 18:38.617
After him!

18:49.170 --> 18:51.379
Filthy pirate.

19:01.349 --> 19:03.642
Hello, Jackie.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.854
Hello, Dad.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.448
I heard you're putting together a crew.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.451
If enough people keep saying it,
it must be true.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.371
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.997
Have you been there?

19:26.958 --> 19:30.168
Does this face look like
it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

19:31.629 --> 19:34.798
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.

19:34.966 --> 19:38.760
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.554
Two chalices.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.724
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.727
From the Ponce de León ship.
You'll need both.

19:47.895 --> 19:51.481
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.693
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.695
Oh, set sail. Love to.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.072
But for that, I may need a ship.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.492
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.203
They're signing up sailors right now.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.539
My heart is pierced by Cupid

20:07.707 --> 20:09.666
I disdain all glittering gold

20:09.834 --> 20:12.168
And one last thing, Jackie.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.882
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.341
My heart is pierced by Cupid

20:18.509 --> 20:20.427
I disdain all glittering gold

20:20.595 --> 20:23.305
There is nothing can console me

20:23.472 --> 20:26.057
But myjolly sailor bold

20:39.196 --> 20:41.406
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.617
Aye. That is,

20:43.784 --> 20:47.537
Jack Sparrow be putting together
a modest venture.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.625
You got some nerve, ain't ya?

20:51.792 --> 20:53.293
Turning up here dressed like that?

20:53.461 --> 20:55.420
What are you, some kind of impostor?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.756
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

21:00.134 --> 21:01.551
Oi, muckers!

21:01.719 --> 21:04.304
There's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name!

21:07.141 --> 21:09.351
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.269
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

21:13.898 --> 21:14.898
Who's next?

21:23.366 --> 21:26.409
Bring us some more of those ones.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.745
Yeah, make it four.

21:37.254 --> 21:41.341
You've stolen me,
and I'm here to take meself back.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.126
Stop doing that.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.096
Only one person alive knows that move.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.980
Always wanted to do that.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.691
Hello, Angelica.

24:06.112 --> 24:09.989
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

24:10.157 --> 24:13.326
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.539
I'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.209
But why?

24:21.377 --> 24:24.003
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.880
That is not a compliment.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.970
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

24:32.138 --> 24:37.267
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

24:37.434 --> 24:41.312
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.983
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

24:45.151 --> 24:49.154
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.991
There is one peculiarity
with which I will not put up with.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.703
I will be impersonated as "Captain."
Nothing less.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.872
Well, for that, you need a ship,

24:59.039 --> 25:01.499
and as it turns out, I have one.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.377
I could use a ship.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.255
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.549
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

25:09.717 --> 25:14.220
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

25:14.388 --> 25:17.098
You still have a few usable years left.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.602
Always so charming.

25:20.769 --> 25:21.853
You didn't answer me.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.564
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

25:24.732 --> 25:28.318
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.112
Wretched pirates!
Find 'em! Maggots!

25:35.367 --> 25:36.492
Friends of yours?

25:36.660 --> 25:39.287
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.206
Open it!

25:41.373 --> 25:44.000
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

25:44.168 --> 25:45.501
Yes.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.337
Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.840
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.

25:51.008 --> 25:52.717
I was innocent of the ways of men.

25:52.885 --> 25:56.137
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.

25:56.305 --> 25:59.057
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!

25:59.225 --> 26:00.767
Open it!

26:00.935 --> 26:04.520
I was ready to take my vows. And you...

26:04.688 --> 26:07.315
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

26:07.483 --> 26:10.193
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.782
- There he is!
- Over there!

26:34.218 --> 26:36.135
We are at a disadvantage.

26:36.303 --> 26:39.681
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be,

26:39.848 --> 26:41.599
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.184
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.974
How can you say I used you?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.310
You know exactly how.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.563
I know, but how can you say it?

27:33.235 --> 27:36.738
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

27:36.905 --> 27:38.406
About the Fountain.

27:41.035 --> 27:42.035
What do you know?

27:44.038 --> 27:45.580
You don't happen to be in possession

27:45.748 --> 27:48.958
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de León?

27:49.710 --> 27:51.544
- No.
- Thought not.

27:51.712 --> 27:55.298
- Why?
- I hear stories.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.258
Rumors.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.552
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.

28:00.471 --> 28:01.596
Yes, I am.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.684
What is it?
What is required?

28:11.315 --> 28:13.274
A mermaid, Jack.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.658
There's been a mistake.

28:22.826 --> 28:26.329
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!

28:31.794 --> 28:35.088
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

28:35.255 --> 28:38.216
I trust you can tie a noose.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.759
That's a hard thing,

28:39.927 --> 28:42.887
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.557
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.769
What's happened to you?

28:49.937 --> 28:53.314
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

28:53.482 --> 28:54.899
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.402
The HMS Providence
sets sail at first light.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.695
If you do not care to watch it
hanging here dead,

28:59.863 --> 29:01.864
with a mouth full of flies...

29:03.534 --> 29:05.159
...speak now.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.372
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

29:09.540 --> 29:14.335
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

29:14.503 --> 29:17.505
Is that where Jack be headed?

29:17.673 --> 29:21.676
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

29:21.844 --> 29:23.344
Anything at all?

29:25.180 --> 29:28.641
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.401
Hand it over.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.450
- You fool!
- I had just enough time

29:45.617 --> 29:48.077
to study those infernal circles.

29:48.245 --> 29:52.874
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.

29:54.376 --> 29:58.379
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy,
Master Gibbs.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.478
Show a leg, sailor!

30:13.645 --> 30:14.854
Aye, sir.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.690
What?

30:17.858 --> 30:21.027
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.490
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

30:25.657 --> 30:27.575
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.952
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

30:30.120 --> 30:31.621
and drank away all his bonus money.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.748
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.292
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.003
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.971
Scrum.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.349
Get your elbows in!

30:53.894 --> 30:55.728
Why is there a glass coffin?

30:55.896 --> 30:58.314
Do I look like a man in charge?

30:58.482 --> 31:01.400
- Where am I?
- 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.194
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard

31:03.362 --> 31:06.614
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen Anne's Revenge.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.661
Blackbeard.

31:28.053 --> 31:29.887
Work!

31:33.725 --> 31:37.436
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.231
Zombiefied.

31:40.399 --> 31:43.859
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.736
Makes 'em more compliant.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.990
And perpetually ill-tempered.

31:50.701 --> 31:53.286
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

32:00.335 --> 32:04.005
Pull! Pull! Pull!

32:08.552 --> 32:11.095
Five days underway, at least.

32:11.263 --> 32:15.057
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

32:15.225 --> 32:16.934
Smell of the crew.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.608
Oi. What did that poor sod do?

32:23.775 --> 32:25.776
And how can I make sure to not?

32:25.944 --> 32:28.237
Him? Churchly fellow.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.406
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.

32:30.574 --> 32:32.283
Bible-thumper on this ship?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.327
A missionary is his story.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.204
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.207
Rest of the ship got killed,
but not 'im.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.667
First mate wouldn't let it happen

32:41.835 --> 32:44.503
on account of his premier standing
with the Lord.

32:44.671 --> 32:49.050
A first mate sticking her neck out
for some prisoner.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.801
That you don't see.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.638
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.014
Back to work!

33:04.358 --> 33:06.567
Steady as she goes.

33:20.832 --> 33:25.169
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.798
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

33:28.965 --> 33:31.759
upon which I am now imprisoned.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.886
We can do this, Jack.

33:34.054 --> 33:38.599
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

33:38.767 --> 33:43.854
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.148
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

33:46.316 --> 33:49.151
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

33:49.319 --> 33:52.196
Maybe to his own daughter?

33:54.783 --> 33:57.660
Daughter as in... beget by?

33:58.578 --> 34:02.373
Long-lost. Recently found.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.335
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

34:06.503 --> 34:08.546
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.805
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,

34:17.973 --> 34:20.808
or him and you, not you and me.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.018
No, Jack, that's the best part.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.229
He will be dead.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.941
You'll be handling
that part yourself, then?

34:29.109 --> 34:31.318
There is a prophecy.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.654
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

34:33.822 --> 34:36.282
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.

34:38.869 --> 34:42.830
The prophecy is this:

34:42.998 --> 34:46.792
Blackbeard will meet his death
within a fortnight

34:46.960 --> 34:50.379
at the hands of a one-legged man.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.715
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.

35:09.065 --> 35:11.817
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.

35:11.985 --> 35:15.029
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.910
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

35:21.077 --> 35:24.497
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.749
And in the king's name,
we behave as such.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.710
Aye, Captain.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.925
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?

35:36.092 --> 35:40.679
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.479
The Spaniard.

35:50.065 --> 35:54.777
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!

35:54.945 --> 35:57.988
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!

35:58.156 --> 36:01.575
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!

36:05.580 --> 36:09.291
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

36:09.459 --> 36:13.295
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.

36:15.423 --> 36:16.757
Steady!

36:18.134 --> 36:19.718
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.

36:25.517 --> 36:29.061
Sir. Orders, sir?

36:35.694 --> 36:38.404
He never so much as turned his head.

36:38.572 --> 36:40.406
The Fountain is the prize.

36:40.574 --> 36:44.159
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

36:44.327 --> 36:48.205
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

36:48.373 --> 36:50.916
All hands, more sail!

36:51.084 --> 36:54.378
Ride hard between wind and tide!

37:04.389 --> 37:07.975
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.519
Mutiny most foul.

37:10.687 --> 37:14.189
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

37:14.357 --> 37:15.608
And a lady, at that.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.943
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.446
Make my toes curl, they do.

37:20.614 --> 37:23.657
I got 'em. All of them.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.743
- Well done.
- Good lad.

37:25.911 --> 37:28.329
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.915
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.834
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.171
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.507
He must come out sometime.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.594
Not really, no.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.139
Any of you sail with him before?

37:47.307 --> 37:48.724
- No, no.
- I've never.

37:48.892 --> 37:49.892
Definitely not.

37:50.060 --> 37:53.896
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.691
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

37:57.859 --> 37:59.860
no one's seen him...

38:00.028 --> 38:03.030
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.990
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

38:05.158 --> 38:07.159
No, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge,
right enough.

38:07.327 --> 38:08.744
How do you know?

38:08.912 --> 38:12.164
I've seen the name,
on the back of the ship.

38:15.418 --> 38:20.381
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

38:22.133 --> 38:24.218
...you have been monstrously deceived.

38:24.386 --> 38:28.514
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

38:28.682 --> 38:31.558
You've nay been informed
of a destination.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.852
Death lies before us

38:34.020 --> 38:38.816
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.319
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

38:42.487 --> 38:46.573
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

38:46.741 --> 38:50.077
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

38:50.245 --> 38:52.746
...we take the ship.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.584
We take the ship, then. Now!

39:01.840 --> 39:03.340
Go on, then.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.760
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!

39:06.928 --> 39:09.138
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!

39:09.305 --> 39:10.931
Get up! Off your backside!

39:12.517 --> 39:14.852
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!

39:15.020 --> 39:16.812
Help me! Fight!

39:30.410 --> 39:31.785
Jack.

39:33.455 --> 39:38.042
If this is a dream,
you can keep the sword and boots on.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.713
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.386
No, it's not!

39:50.722 --> 39:53.265
I thought I should give you
fair warning, we're taking the ship.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.809
Nothing personal.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.771
Think you might be better off
if you just...

40:00.440 --> 40:01.732
...stay out of it.

40:25.340 --> 40:26.632
Boggit.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.530
Wretch!

41:19.185 --> 41:21.145
You're either with us or against us!

41:21.312 --> 41:23.480
I am not with you,
neither am I against you!

41:23.648 --> 41:24.982
Can he do that?

41:25.150 --> 41:28.152
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.785
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

41:48.631 --> 41:51.008
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!

42:05.773 --> 42:07.482
The ship is ours!

42:36.346 --> 42:38.555
Gentlemen.

42:46.022 --> 42:49.483
I be placed in a bewilderment.

42:49.651 --> 42:54.279
There I were, resting,

42:54.447 --> 42:59.076
and upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.

43:02.163 --> 43:04.081
Sailors abandon their posts

43:04.249 --> 43:06.750
without orders, without leave.

43:07.877 --> 43:11.088
Men before the mast,

43:11.256 --> 43:13.632
taking the ship for themselves.

43:15.385 --> 43:17.678
What be that, First Mate?

43:17.845 --> 43:20.681
- Mutiny, Captain.
- Again?

43:20.848 --> 43:23.809
- Mutiny!
- Aye.

43:24.394 --> 43:26.061
Mutiny.

43:28.606 --> 43:32.025
And what fate befalls mutineers?

43:32.193 --> 43:35.696
Now, we know the answer to that,
do we not?

43:35.863 --> 43:39.408
Mutineers hang!

44:29.250 --> 44:30.959
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.087
I can name fingers and point names.

44:34.255 --> 44:35.714
No need, Mr. Sparrow.

44:35.882 --> 44:39.092
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.

44:44.015 --> 44:46.683
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter you have?

44:47.352 --> 44:49.770
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.314
Remember, Father.
We need him.

44:52.482 --> 44:53.940
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,

44:54.108 --> 44:56.485
- they forget who I am.
- Coward!

44:58.154 --> 45:00.280
They do not forget.

45:00.448 --> 45:02.824
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

45:02.992 --> 45:05.285
A coward, no matter how many you slay.

45:05.453 --> 45:07.829
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.

45:07.997 --> 45:10.123
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.126
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

45:13.294 --> 45:17.506
No, sir. The truth is
it be much simpler than all that.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.550
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.677
I might have to kill you too, catechist.

45:22.845 --> 45:25.430
- No!
- All Latin blood like her mother.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.641
Father, I beg you.

45:27.809 --> 45:31.520
There I be again,
forgetting why the missionary is here.

45:31.687 --> 45:36.066
My daughter fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

45:37.110 --> 45:40.737
You truly wish to save me, my child?

45:40.905 --> 45:42.823
Every soul can be saved.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.742
Be that true, young cleric?

45:45.910 --> 45:49.579
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

45:50.623 --> 45:54.543
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

45:57.130 --> 45:59.756
You disarm me with your faith.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.592
Eight bells!

46:02.760 --> 46:05.720
Which of you unfortunate souls
stood watch?

46:05.888 --> 46:10.851
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

46:16.232 --> 46:17.607
You?

46:18.317 --> 46:22.237
Aye.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.364
The cook.

46:24.532 --> 46:27.367
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

46:32.665 --> 46:34.624
Bring her about!

46:46.220 --> 46:49.222
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

46:49.390 --> 46:51.641
Our laws allow the Captain
to show leniency.

46:51.809 --> 46:54.394
I have given this man
a chance to determine his fate,

46:54.562 --> 46:56.229
a gift not afforded to all.

47:05.364 --> 47:06.781
Oh, you now.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.702
Chance to show the worth
of your prayers.

47:10.870 --> 47:14.915
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

47:23.257 --> 47:24.591
Course made!

47:24.759 --> 47:26.593
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...

47:52.328 --> 47:54.913
You know when I feel closest
to our Maker?

47:55.081 --> 47:56.915
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.

47:57.083 --> 47:59.584
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

47:59.752 --> 48:03.421
And I see it revealed when in times
of hardship and tragedy,

48:03.589 --> 48:05.840
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

48:06.008 --> 48:08.385
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

48:08.553 --> 48:10.720
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!

48:23.484 --> 48:26.027
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,

48:26.195 --> 48:28.029
so, if your heart is set,

48:28.197 --> 48:30.365
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.284
That'll be all, Quartermaster.

48:35.329 --> 48:38.790
Your words surround you like fog
and make you hard to see.

48:38.958 --> 48:42.752
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

48:42.920 --> 48:45.672
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

48:45.840 --> 48:49.259
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

48:49.427 --> 48:52.012
And here you are, running scared.

48:52.680 --> 48:56.057
- Scared.
- To the Fountain.

48:56.225 --> 48:59.227
The Quartermaster
sees things before they happen.

48:59.395 --> 49:03.857
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

49:04.025 --> 49:06.359
The threads of destiny woven.

49:06.527 --> 49:09.446
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

49:09.614 --> 49:11.197
- And you?
- Me?

49:11.365 --> 49:15.619
I'm skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

49:15.786 --> 49:21.541
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.

49:21.709 --> 49:24.544
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

49:27.048 --> 49:31.009
That knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

49:31.177 --> 49:32.927
Mutiny served me well.

49:33.095 --> 49:35.013
It gained me an audience with you.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.224
Aye.

49:39.685 --> 49:41.436
To warn you.

49:42.438 --> 49:43.980
Regarding your first mate,

49:44.148 --> 49:47.025
who pretends to be persons she is not.

49:47.652 --> 49:48.652
Do tell.

49:51.238 --> 49:53.031
She is not your daughter.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.371
You dare to speak
thusly of my flesh and blood?

49:59.538 --> 50:04.042
Sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

50:04.210 --> 50:08.630
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

50:08.798 --> 50:10.715
Though I cannot claim credit

50:10.883 --> 50:13.802
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

50:15.846 --> 50:18.306
Angelica.
My beloved daughter,

50:18.474 --> 50:21.059
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

50:21.227 --> 50:23.853
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

50:24.021 --> 50:28.024
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.568
More to be feared than a wild beast.

50:30.736 --> 50:34.531
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.

50:34.699 --> 50:36.700
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...

50:36.867 --> 50:38.993
- Father?
- Sweetness!

50:40.955 --> 50:42.497
No need to hurt him, Father.

50:42.665 --> 50:45.875
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

50:46.043 --> 50:49.754
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

50:49.922 --> 50:53.466
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

51:01.058 --> 51:05.520
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?

51:06.355 --> 51:08.022
Put another way.

51:08.858 --> 51:12.235
If I do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

51:13.904 --> 51:16.865
...neither will you.

51:19.034 --> 51:23.163
I'll have a wee look-see at those charts
straight away then, shall I?

51:26.917 --> 51:28.168
Sir.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.381
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

51:33.549 --> 51:35.925
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

51:36.093 --> 51:38.261
among the crew,
as to our destination.

51:39.472 --> 51:41.431
Shut your trap and make way.

51:45.478 --> 51:49.063
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.

51:49.899 --> 51:52.692
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

51:53.486 --> 51:54.778
Whitecap Bay.

51:54.945 --> 51:58.031
Aye, Whitecap Bay.

51:58.199 --> 52:02.243
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

52:02.411 --> 52:04.746
though few know why or dare to ask.

52:04.914 --> 52:06.539
Be the stories true?

52:06.707 --> 52:08.500
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

52:08.667 --> 52:11.795
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

52:14.507 --> 52:16.090
Mermaids, Captain.

52:16.258 --> 52:18.009
Aye. Mermaids.

52:18.177 --> 52:22.305
Sea ghouls, devil fish,
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

52:22.473 --> 52:26.017
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

52:26.185 --> 52:27.727
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

52:27.895 --> 52:31.523
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

52:31.690 --> 52:33.066
...to the bone.

52:34.652 --> 52:37.779
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage,

52:37.947 --> 52:39.823
or be ready to purpose your fear!

52:39.990 --> 52:42.367
Save yourselves!

52:44.954 --> 52:47.789
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.

52:47.957 --> 52:49.707
- Come about.
- Nay!

52:51.001 --> 52:54.796
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what

52:54.964 --> 52:59.425
that man can deliver, but I do ask this:
Are we not king's men?

52:59.593 --> 53:01.010
Aye.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.930
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.

53:04.098 --> 53:08.309
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.

53:08.477 --> 53:11.187
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye!

53:11.355 --> 53:14.274
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!

53:14.441 --> 53:17.360
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

53:19.029 --> 53:21.364
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

53:35.379 --> 53:36.838
Come.

53:37.006 --> 53:38.298
Little drink?

53:38.465 --> 53:41.676
Wine, music, candlelight.

53:41.844 --> 53:44.053
I think we've traveled down
this road before, Jack.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.014
Yes, we have.

53:47.016 --> 53:48.391
I remember it well.

53:50.269 --> 53:55.064
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.

53:55.232 --> 53:57.525
Incessant writhing.

53:57.693 --> 53:59.527
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

54:00.946 --> 54:02.530
La Martinique.

54:02.698 --> 54:04.365
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

54:04.533 --> 54:06.284
Either or.

54:07.119 --> 54:09.120
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

54:09.288 --> 54:12.707
Was I the first? I've often wondered.

54:12.875 --> 54:17.086
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.714
The trick is finding out what.

54:20.841 --> 54:22.926
The truth, then, is it?

54:23.677 --> 54:26.137
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

54:26.305 --> 54:28.598
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,

54:28.766 --> 54:31.809
where we shall bathe one another
in equal shares of fame

54:31.977 --> 54:33.978
and other assorted debaucheries.

54:34.146 --> 54:37.106
And I'll tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

54:37.274 --> 54:40.068
Yes. The profane ritual.

54:42.821 --> 54:44.989
Can I trust you, Jack?

54:45.157 --> 54:49.535
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

54:49.703 --> 54:53.122
You and I are as
thick as thieves, love.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.500
Tell me the rules.

54:57.670 --> 55:01.297
Water from the Fountain of Youth.

55:03.175 --> 55:06.552
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

55:06.720 --> 55:10.014
The silver chalices of Ponce de León.

55:11.976 --> 55:13.685
With these items...

55:13.852 --> 55:15.937
- Yes?
- With these items,

55:16.105 --> 55:19.482
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

55:21.777 --> 55:23.569
You know what that means.

55:23.737 --> 55:26.614
We cannot go alone, you and I.

55:26.782 --> 55:29.033
The ritual requires a victim.

55:30.786 --> 55:34.622
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

55:35.666 --> 55:38.501
I find my desire for the Fountain
greatly lessened.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.547
But there is something onboard
you do want.

55:48.345 --> 55:49.679
What about Blackbeard?

55:49.847 --> 55:53.433
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

56:02.526 --> 56:05.111
He keeps each ship as a prize.

56:06.905 --> 56:11.325
You help me,
and I promise you your pick.

56:11.493 --> 56:14.871
Though I think I know the one
you will choose.

56:20.794 --> 56:23.254
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

56:23.422 --> 56:25.131
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

56:30.929 --> 56:33.765
He's even more annoying in miniature.

56:33.932 --> 56:37.935
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

56:38.103 --> 56:40.938
You are not going to steal the life
of some innocent man.

56:41.523 --> 56:43.816
What about the one-legged man?

56:46.070 --> 56:47.695
I need years, Jack.

56:49.531 --> 56:52.950
Not for me. For my father.

56:55.579 --> 56:57.872
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

56:58.916 --> 57:01.084
You've fallen for your own con, love.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.503
No, he is my father.

57:03.670 --> 57:05.338
The lies I told you were not lies.

57:07.174 --> 57:10.009
You lied to me by telling me the truth?

57:10.177 --> 57:12.178
- Yes.
- That's very good.

57:12.346 --> 57:14.764
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.

57:14.932 --> 57:17.266
Of course I will.

57:17.434 --> 57:20.103
So, will you not give up this quest?

57:20.729 --> 57:23.856
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

57:25.109 --> 57:28.361
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

57:29.947 --> 57:31.280
...he is evil,

57:31.448 --> 57:33.616
and he will kill you given the chance.

57:33.784 --> 57:36.869
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

57:37.037 --> 57:39.205
the limits on redemption?

57:39.373 --> 57:42.667
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.

57:42.835 --> 57:45.878
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

57:46.046 --> 57:48.339
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.

57:48.507 --> 57:52.218
Whitecap Bay!

57:57.349 --> 58:00.726
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!

58:04.815 --> 58:05.815
Lay 'em out flat!

58:06.525 --> 58:11.279
No tangles. Make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.

58:11.446 --> 58:15.241
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.

58:17.035 --> 58:18.035
Come!

58:39.850 --> 58:45.062
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

58:45.230 --> 58:48.941
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.193
Let's not get our hopes up.

59:01.246 --> 59:03.164
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

59:03.332 --> 59:04.540
First of the summer.

59:05.459 --> 59:08.669
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

59:20.974 --> 59:24.852
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.

59:25.020 --> 59:27.688
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

59:27.856 --> 59:30.358
There'll be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

59:30.525 --> 59:33.986
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

59:38.659 --> 59:42.286
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

59:42.454 --> 59:46.290
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son,

59:46.458 --> 59:49.210
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

59:49.378 --> 59:53.631
But when it comes time
to churn butter, so to speak,

59:53.799 --> 59:55.758
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

59:55.926 --> 59:58.928
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

59:59.096 --> 01:00:04.016
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:07.895
Or, sometimes, the other way around.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.816
- Sing.
- What?

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:15.319
They like to hear singing.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.244
My name is Maria

01:00:23.412 --> 01:00:26.539
A merchant's daughter fair

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:30.293
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.629
And 3,000 pounds a year

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.799
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:40.386
I disdain all glittering gold

01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:44.015
There is nothing can console me

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.059
But myjolly sailor bold

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:52.773
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:56.610
I disdain all glittering gold

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:59.488
There is nothing can console me

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:04.118
But myjolly sailor bold

01:01:22.054 --> 01:01:23.554
Lord save me.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:30.269
Man, look. Look there.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:32.229
You'll scare her off!

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:33.898
Aye, and good riddance!

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.571
Can you talk?

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.784
Yes.

01:01:51.833 --> 01:01:53.793
You're beautiful.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:58.381
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.719
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.182
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:11.519
Boys! There ain't much
been given to me

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:14.063
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.940
But, by God, I'll have it said

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:19.485
that Scrum had himself a kiss
from a proper mermaid!

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:24.365
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:28.035
I disdain all glittering gold

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:31.580
There is nothing can console me

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:35.835
But myjolly sailor bold

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:40.840
Come all ye pretty fair maids

01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:45.219
Whoever you may be

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:48.931
Who love a jolly sailor bold

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:53.811
That ploughs the raging sea

01:02:53.979 --> 01:02:58.065
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:02.403
I disdain all glittering gold

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:06.740
There is nothing can console me

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:11.245
But myjolly sailor bold

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:16.542
My heart is pierced by Cupid

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:19.920
I disdain all glittering gold

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:24.133
There is nothing can console me

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:28.095
But myjolly sailor bold

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.259
Out upon it! It has begun!

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:51.011
Light 'em up!

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:55.724
Muster your courage!
Drive 'em to shore!

01:05:06.194 --> 01:05:09.613
Nets into the water! Quickly!

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:02.499
Retreat, all, to land!
For your lives!

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.254
Retreat, I say!

01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:09.423
Cowards! Back in the water!

01:06:09.591 --> 01:06:13.761
There be no refuge on land! On my word!

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:48.420
Come on!

01:08:23.016 --> 01:08:25.184
We got one!

01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:30.814
I'm in love!

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:34.985
Check the wounded!

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:37.905
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive!

01:09:17.237 --> 01:09:18.362
Come, give a hand!

01:09:19.614 --> 01:09:21.615
Well done, sailor.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.243
Did everyone see that?

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.411
Because I will not be doing it again.

01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:31.250
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.

01:09:48.101 --> 01:09:51.019
- Lord. Is that?
- Mermaid.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:54.690
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:56.608
Ever walk on the beach,

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:59.027
look back and see your footsteps
in the sand?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:03.156
It's like that,
except the footsteps lie before me.

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:07.119
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:08.871
We must hasten.

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:20.549
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a heading.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.844
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.

01:10:24.012 --> 01:10:27.097
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:31.560
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.770
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:40.235
Seagulls... nesting.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.447
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

01:10:52.123 --> 01:10:53.665
My God.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.834
Your head or my heading.

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.170
I'll have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.636
All hands, forward!

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:25.572
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:28.367
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:33.205
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.

01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:35.082
What I want first...

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.712
...is Ponce De León's ship.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.626
Why is it we've got to bring her along?

01:12:19.794 --> 01:12:23.005
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.882
What is the ritual again?

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.468
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:30.137
And two silver chalices.

01:12:30.304 --> 01:12:32.931
One cup with a tear, one without.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:36.601
So, one with a tear and water in both?

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.270
Quite complicated, is it not?

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:41.481
Both get water. One gets a tear.

01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:44.276
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.903
gets all the years of life
from the other.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.157
How many years?

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.578
All the years
that they have lived,

01:12:54.746 --> 01:12:58.248
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:08.842
Clergyman.

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:13.764
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.474
I would like it noted here and now

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:18.852
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.771
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:23.315
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

01:13:23.483 --> 01:13:27.110
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.738
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:34.993
Quartermaster!

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.329
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:40.540
- She has water.
- She needs air!

01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:46.421
- Open this.
- She will escape.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:50.300
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

01:13:58.851 --> 01:13:59.893
See?

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.650
Onward.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:34.302
Just as I thought. Not this way!

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:37.806
This is the way, isn't it?

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.767
'Course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.769
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.688
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:46.481
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.608
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:50.861
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:53.446
You mean split up?

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:56.491
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:15:00.579
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.747
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:06.126
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:08.753
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.339
She'll go.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:16.720
How much farther to the Fountain?

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:18.555
I'm running out of time.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:22.684
About a day's march north,
following that river,

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:26.313
you'll get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:30.066
You will go.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:35.280
I was sure it would come to this.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:53.006
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:55.091
Sudden urge to jump?

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.553
I don't have it.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.473
I need those chalices.

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:04.100
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:07.312
You will go. You will return...

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:10.607
...or I will kill her.

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:14.945
You won't kill your own daughter.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.864
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:19.616
remove the shot from all but two,

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:22.244
but do not tell me which two.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:27.123
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:34.339
No.

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:40.262
- Yes.
- You're sure?

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.846
'Course I am.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:51.147
Again.

01:16:52.692 --> 01:16:55.193
Please, they're not even loaded.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:01.408
Again.

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:04.160
If you're so keen on killing her,

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:06.705
- why don't you just let herjump?
- What?

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:09.958
If you jump and die,

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:13.753
then she will have her chance.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:15.380
Again.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.510
Oi...

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:24.514
...if I jump, will I survive?

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:28.184
The doll.

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:49.247
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:11.227
Wet. Wet again.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.441
We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:18.610
Well played, Father.

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:22.697
You knew which guns were loaded, right?

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:27.410
Of course, my love.

01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:39.798
Be nice to have a map about now.

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.591
Or a ship.

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:46.054
Stop! Hold very still.

01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:51.017
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:02.987
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.657
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:07.992
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.327
Push on!

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:14.290
Fortune continues to favor us.

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:44.279
The Santiago.

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:47.157
Famously captained by Ponce de León.

01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:51.369
There's no one there.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:52.537
Right, then.

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:28.615
We must not stop.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.416
You will walk.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:59.729
I cannot.

01:20:59.897 --> 01:21:01.648
Walk or die.

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:09.322
Put your arms around me.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:12.867
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:34.097
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.159
Hold here 'til I say!

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:10.091
Such beauty.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.553
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

01:22:13.721 --> 01:22:16.639
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

01:22:16.807 --> 01:22:19.058
who found no refuge on the Ark.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.980
Such beauty...

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:26.858
...and yet deadly.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:31.321
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:36.409
No. You are different.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.536
Different?

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:42.707
Are you not? You protect.

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.170
Did you?

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:51.591
You pushed me down out of the way.

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:57.221
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.641
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.768
She has a name!

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:07.815
Pray tell.

01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:15.907
She is Syrena.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.408
Ponce de León.

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:05.790
If 40 pirates
dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:09.502
it would not match
the contents of this room.

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:11.212
You.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:15.800
- You.
- No...

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:19.220
...you.
- I was here first.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:23.391
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:26.018
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:29.522
- for my royal liege.
- Oh, please.

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:32.567
Back, back! We have to balance it out!

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:37.155
The whole ship will slide!

01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:42.535
Right, then.

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:48.624
What ifwe each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:52.712
Put it back!

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:56.299
We touch nothing!

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:05.183
What about that?

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:07.685
The chalices.

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:10.938
Oi! Why do you get to look first?

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:12.774
Fine, then.

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:33.586
- Together.
- Together.

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.340
Rocks.

01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:39.759
The Spanish.

01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:42.178
They're ahead of us, mate.

01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:46.349
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...

01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:58.653
I wonder why they left this behind.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:05.409
Don't touch the map.

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:11.874
They know the path,

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:15.920
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:30.685
Jack!

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:38.025
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out ofjail.

01:26:39.987 --> 01:26:41.487
You stole my map.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:44.490
Right. Best be started.

01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:49.078
Olé.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:07.972
Mermaids.

01:27:10.809 --> 01:27:13.728
Careful, these pools run deep.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:17.440
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:22.361
Look. Look!

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:26.908
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.661
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:34.999
butjust enough to make the dying slow.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.209
Think on it.

01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:40.755
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:45.217
Syrena, won't you cry?

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.929
All die, even you.

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:51.515
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.436
Listen.

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:58.898
Can you not hear your sisters scream?

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:01.484
Do you not hear them?

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:05.321
We need but one tear.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.492
Vile creature!

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:12.203
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!

01:28:12.371 --> 01:28:14.956
Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes!

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:16.415
Where's your voice in this?

01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:20.336
Maybe she'll have a change of heart
when the sun rises.

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:24.382
Oh, aye, she will burn,
but I cannot wait for the sun.

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:26.217
Perhaps we should build a fire.

01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:28.511
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:31.722
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:35.017
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one if I see fit.

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:36.727
If that displeases you, go pray.

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:39.981
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.984
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:46.028
That vile creature, as you call her,
is worth a hundred of you.

01:28:46.196 --> 01:28:47.905
Oh, you care for her?

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:51.951
You fancy her.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.372
And do not deny what is
clear to my eyes.

01:28:58.208 --> 01:28:59.291
Question is...

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:04.463
...does she fancy you?

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:10.302
By God, she does. We are in luck!

01:29:11.763 --> 01:29:13.597
Bring forth a tear...

01:29:15.142 --> 01:29:17.643
...or witness the death
of this poor soul.

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:23.232
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.942
I would be grateful.

01:29:26.319 --> 01:29:27.903
Sadness, yes,

01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:33.451
- but no sorrow... yet.
- Not by your hand, Father!

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:36.245
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:52.053
Aye, mermaids are tough.

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.221
The lot of them.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:58.768
Tie her up like the others.
And get rid of this.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:06.317
- You are confident?
- Yes.

01:30:06.485 --> 01:30:09.445
I am a woman. So is she.

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:20.498
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:23.334
There is a girl...

01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:26.670
...a female... of the opposite sex.

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.758
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."

01:30:30.926 --> 01:30:33.928
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

01:30:34.096 --> 01:30:37.306
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel

01:30:37.474 --> 01:30:41.018
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:44.480
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.

01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:48.526
Ah, you pretended to love her,
then you left her and broke her heart.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:53.364
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:58.702
...stirrings.
- Stirrings?

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:02.832
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:06.001
No, no, no. Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

01:31:10.132 --> 01:31:11.715
All right, feelings, damn you.

01:31:11.883 --> 01:31:16.554
And you left her still.
That's low.

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:19.223
Thank you.

01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:27.565
Stealth over force.

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:31.443
I'll take it from here
on account of your condition.

01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:34.446
You don't have termites, do you?

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:36.574
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.243
but I'll be keeping
you company all the same.

01:31:39.411 --> 01:31:42.454
Hold here, Lieutenant Commander.
Wait for my signal.

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:16.530
There. That one.
That be the leader.

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:19.158
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:24.872
No, wait. By God,
that must be them right there.

01:32:28.418 --> 01:32:30.628
Your sword smells funny.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:35.674
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

01:32:35.842 --> 01:32:38.928
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:41.388
Would you mind pointing it
the other way?

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:43.307
I don't like toads.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:51.607
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:55.819
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

01:32:55.987 --> 01:32:59.073
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:27.559
Now what?

01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:30.980
We stroll out, slow and steady.

01:33:31.147 --> 01:33:32.940
Just like we belong.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:36.628
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

01:34:36.796 --> 01:34:40.966
- Yes.
- You came for me.

01:34:42.844 --> 01:34:44.345
Why?

01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:48.766
You're different, are you not?

01:34:50.977 --> 01:34:55.314
Do you know not of kindness?
Compassion?

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.500
Tears of sorrow, never.

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:17.086
Mermaids be too tough for that.

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:19.380
But tears ofjoy...

01:35:20.924 --> 01:35:23.300
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:26.428
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:29.139
Let her go.
You don't need her now.

01:35:29.307 --> 01:35:32.226
Let her go? No.

01:35:32.394 --> 01:35:35.354
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:46.907
How's that escape route working?

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:49.993
Here's your chance to improvise.

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:51.453
I'm attempting it.

01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:54.415
I might be able to get a hand loose.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:56.834
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

01:35:57.961 --> 01:35:59.461
Better.

01:36:04.926 --> 01:36:06.176
I want one of those.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:15.102
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:19.690
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.

01:36:19.858 --> 01:36:21.233
If you wanted the chalices,

01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:24.069
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

01:36:24.237 --> 01:36:27.364
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.

01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:32.578
King George. Privateer. Wig.

01:36:33.746 --> 01:36:35.164
Cheap theatrical facade.

01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:38.167
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:42.129
- When the Pearlwas lost?
- Taken, not lost.

01:36:44.757 --> 01:36:48.886
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.

01:36:49.053 --> 01:36:52.473
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.267
We were peppered with cannon fire.

01:36:56.436 --> 01:36:59.646
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.

01:37:01.232 --> 01:37:03.609
The Pearlwas pitching
and yawing violently.

01:37:03.776 --> 01:37:05.611
Every plank, every rail,

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:08.614
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:11.783
The rigging had come to life.

01:37:11.951 --> 01:37:14.620
Our own ship turned against us...

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:18.040
...tangling the crew,
wrapping around 'em like snakes.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:20.584
And wrapping around me leg.

01:37:20.752 --> 01:37:23.128
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:26.798
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

01:37:26.966 --> 01:37:30.427
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

01:37:31.471 --> 01:37:33.805
So I did what needed done.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:42.606
I survived.

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:48.362
So... you're not after the Fountain.

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:52.157
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

01:37:52.325 --> 01:37:54.535
that give hope for a healed limb.

01:37:56.204 --> 01:37:59.831
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

01:37:59.999 --> 01:38:03.001
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:07.798
to drive my poisoned blade
through his heart.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.218
I'll see you get the chance, mate.

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:31.298
The prisoner's escaping.

01:39:38.598 --> 01:39:41.266
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!

01:39:41.434 --> 01:39:42.517
Go! Go!

01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:47.439
Hold your fire! I want him alive!

01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:57.616
I figured that was the signal.

01:40:40.743 --> 01:40:44.204
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:48.875
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I've an appointment to keep.

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:52.003
- I'll not be going back.
- No need.

01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:55.173
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the Fountain.

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:17.112
How is it we can never meet
without you pointing something at me?

01:41:18.322 --> 01:41:20.198
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?

01:41:20.366 --> 01:41:22.951
Aye. Oi!

01:41:26.456 --> 01:41:29.541
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:32.919
And the one-legged man, he is near.
Aye?

01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:34.463
Aye.

01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:36.298
Now...

01:41:36.466 --> 01:41:39.259
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

01:41:39.427 --> 01:41:41.470
- Name them.
- Firstly,

01:41:41.637 --> 01:41:43.972
I'll be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.

01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:46.349
Firstly, upon your word,

01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:48.477
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

01:41:48.644 --> 01:41:50.979
I'll make no vows
to the likes of you, Sparrow.

01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:53.565
But it costs me nothing to admit

01:41:53.733 --> 01:41:56.568
that she was never in harm's way.

01:41:57.236 --> 01:41:59.404
Secondly then, priorly firstly,

01:41:59.572 --> 01:42:01.198
I will be having me compass back.

01:42:02.116 --> 01:42:04.117
Please? I do deserve it.

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:07.746
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

01:42:07.914 --> 01:42:10.248
Not the big one,
the four-legged one.

01:42:13.711 --> 01:42:17.464
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,

01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:20.300
there are times, not very often,

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:23.553
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

01:42:23.721 --> 01:42:27.974
Chief among them, I note how poorly
I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:30.769
- my loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...

01:42:30.937 --> 01:42:33.605
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:38.401
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

01:42:40.279 --> 01:42:43.615
- Is that it?
- I think so.

01:42:43.783 --> 01:42:46.368
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting those chalices.

01:42:46.536 --> 01:42:47.953
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.412
Done.

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:50.747
Release the swine.

01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:59.798
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...

01:43:02.593 --> 01:43:04.803
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

01:43:11.519 --> 01:43:14.354
I could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.

01:44:44.487 --> 01:44:46.821
We must not stop.

01:45:04.173 --> 01:45:05.548
Dead end.

01:45:06.592 --> 01:45:08.510
Dead. End.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.595
Dead end.

01:45:11.681 --> 01:45:14.599
Jack, I'm starting to think
you don't know where you're going.

01:45:15.434 --> 01:45:18.228
It is not the destination
so much as the journey, they say.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.897
Chalices, if you please.

01:45:32.952 --> 01:45:34.452
Stand back.

01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:58.393
Jack...

01:45:58.561 --> 01:46:00.395
...have you ever, in fact...

01:46:00.563 --> 01:46:06.109
...seen with your own eyes...
the Fountain of Youth?

01:46:06.277 --> 01:46:08.445
I'm sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?

01:46:08.612 --> 01:46:10.071
Quartermaster.

01:46:11.032 --> 01:46:11.948
No, no!

01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:17.787
Wait, wait! Wait.

01:46:21.083 --> 01:46:25.503
"Aqua... de Vida."

01:47:04.877 --> 01:47:07.378
Master Scrum...

01:47:07.546 --> 01:47:10.381
...do you mind?
- Squire?

01:48:09.108 --> 01:48:11.067
So beautiful.

01:48:50.608 --> 01:48:53.193
Sparrow, I'll be the first
to taste those waters.

01:48:57.698 --> 01:48:59.282
Father.

01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:04.829
The one-legged man.

01:49:07.416 --> 01:49:11.336
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

01:49:11.503 --> 01:49:13.588
Edward Teach!

01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:17.008
For crimes committed on the high seas,

01:49:17.176 --> 01:49:21.012
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...

01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:24.349
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

01:49:24.516 --> 01:49:27.560
...I hereby place you
in the custody of the court,

01:49:27.728 --> 01:49:31.022
and declare you to be my prisoner.

01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:35.610
My trick's out, is that it?

01:49:35.778 --> 01:49:40.156
Such crimes do include, but are not
limited to, piracy, treason,

01:49:40.324 --> 01:49:44.452
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.498
including the brutal theft of one used,
twisted, hairy right leg.

01:49:49.333 --> 01:49:54.003
You... dare face this sword?

01:49:54.171 --> 01:49:56.589
This far away from your ship? Aye.

01:49:56.757 --> 01:50:01.469
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.

01:50:01.637 --> 01:50:07.267
But I'll have one last fight, by God.

01:50:07.434 --> 01:50:09.143
Kill 'em all!

01:50:10.813 --> 01:50:12.563
Hang on a minute.

01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:16.609
I just... I just need
to understand something.

01:50:16.777 --> 01:50:20.113
Right, so, you will fight against them,

01:50:20.281 --> 01:50:21.572
they will fight against you.

01:50:21.740 --> 01:50:25.410
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?

01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:29.497
Where is the sense? Exactly.

01:50:29.665 --> 01:50:33.376
I say, let them fight
each other while we lay back,

01:50:33.544 --> 01:50:36.963
watch, have a drink,
place some wagers!

01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:39.382
Aye.

01:50:41.969 --> 01:50:43.553
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!

01:51:14.084 --> 01:51:15.710
Get off me!

01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:49.702
Scrum, the chalices!

01:51:51.872 --> 01:51:52.955
And the tear! Follow!

01:51:57.002 --> 01:51:58.169
Fight!

01:51:59.129 --> 01:52:02.632
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.093
I'm more afraid of her
than I am of you.

01:52:10.641 --> 01:52:13.017
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.

01:52:16.438 --> 01:52:20.149
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

01:52:20.317 --> 01:52:24.529
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.

01:52:32.496 --> 01:52:33.663
Scrum!

01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:56.811
Syrena...

01:53:00.524 --> 01:53:03.317
Oh God, you will not take her.

01:53:03.485 --> 01:53:08.406
If you have taken her,
you will give her back.

01:53:08.574 --> 01:53:10.908
Give her back...

01:53:11.076 --> 01:53:13.911
Give her back, please. Please.

01:53:37.561 --> 01:53:40.271
I expected fate
to put up more of a fight, eh?

01:53:57.164 --> 01:54:00.875
I will not have that smile
on your face as I strike you down.

01:54:02.377 --> 01:54:05.421
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

01:54:35.994 --> 01:54:39.288
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

01:54:39.456 --> 01:54:41.999
of His Majesty King George...

01:54:48.298 --> 01:54:51.175
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

01:54:58.183 --> 01:55:01.894
Señorita, the chalices, porfavor.

01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:24.250
Only God can grant eternal life,
not this pagan water.

01:55:35.345 --> 01:55:38.806
Men, destroy this profane temple!

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.852
The Fountain!

01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:58.451
You are a fool.

01:55:58.619 --> 01:56:01.871
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

01:56:02.039 --> 01:56:04.540
Faith? In faith,
there is light enough to see

01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:06.917
but darkness enough to blind.

01:56:10.547 --> 01:56:12.798
What devilry is this?

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:19.388
- For the Pearl.
- What have you done?

01:56:22.934 --> 01:56:25.311
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

01:56:29.983 --> 01:56:32.276
I'm not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard

01:56:32.444 --> 01:56:35.821
without a little venomous advantage.

01:56:37.157 --> 01:56:38.616
Jack!

01:56:50.462 --> 01:56:52.505
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

01:56:52.673 --> 01:56:56.092
and this sword,
payment for my missing limb!

01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:11.899
Hang on! Pull!

01:57:57.195 --> 01:57:59.530
Do not waste my tear.

01:58:29.019 --> 01:58:31.145
Drink this.
This one has the tear.

01:58:31.313 --> 01:58:33.272
- You must drink the other.
- No!

01:58:34.065 --> 01:58:37.276
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

01:58:38.236 --> 01:58:41.322
You take it, Father, for your soul.

01:58:43.366 --> 01:58:48.788
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

01:58:49.998 --> 01:58:52.750
This one takes life?

01:58:52.918 --> 01:58:54.752
This one has the tear and gives life?

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.170
Aye, hurry!

01:59:05.096 --> 01:59:09.350
Angelica...
Save me, my child.

01:59:11.269 --> 01:59:12.686
No.

01:59:21.404 --> 01:59:22.822
I love you, Father.

01:59:35.836 --> 01:59:37.419
Wait a minute.

01:59:39.631 --> 01:59:42.424
In fact, it might have been
the other way around.

01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:47.096
This cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.

01:59:47.264 --> 01:59:48.472
Trickster!

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.474
- Devil!
- Father!

01:59:57.524 --> 01:59:59.024
You bastard! How could you?

02:00:00.068 --> 02:00:01.485
Your father saved you.

02:00:01.653 --> 02:00:04.154
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

02:01:05.008 --> 02:01:07.092
You are hurt.

02:01:09.346 --> 02:01:11.221
In body only.

02:01:12.933 --> 02:01:17.144
My mind is at peace...
because of you.

02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:21.065
- Me?
- Yes.

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:24.485
I was lost.

02:01:25.487 --> 02:01:30.115
The wind, the tides...

02:01:30.283 --> 02:01:33.327
...they ought to renew a man's faith.

02:01:34.913 --> 02:01:36.830
But for me, only you.

02:01:37.749 --> 02:01:41.460
Philip, I can save you.

02:01:41.628 --> 02:01:44.546
You need only ask.

02:01:46.049 --> 02:01:50.803
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

02:01:51.846 --> 02:01:54.181
Forgiveness.

02:01:54.349 --> 02:01:57.643
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.

02:01:57.811 --> 02:01:59.436
Ask.

02:02:01.356 --> 02:02:03.148
Forgive me?

02:02:28.299 --> 02:02:29.508
I hate you.

02:02:29.676 --> 02:02:31.969
The bloke who saved your life?

02:02:32.137 --> 02:02:35.305
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father!

02:02:35.473 --> 02:02:38.475
I only helped Blackbeard do what
any father should have done.

02:02:38.643 --> 02:02:41.812
You are cruel and ignorant.

02:02:45.567 --> 02:02:49.319
One pistol, one shot.

02:02:49.487 --> 02:02:51.697
To kill myself before I starve?

02:02:51.865 --> 02:02:53.407
There's no trusting you, love.

02:02:53.575 --> 02:02:55.993
Besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.

02:02:56.161 --> 02:02:57.745
You can signal a passing ship.

02:02:57.912 --> 02:03:01.331
Or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.

02:03:01.499 --> 02:03:03.083
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

02:03:03.251 --> 02:03:05.961
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

02:03:06.129 --> 02:03:08.922
waiting for the precise moment
to pounce.

02:03:11.634 --> 02:03:13.302
Admit it, Jack.

02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:17.347
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

02:03:17.515 --> 02:03:19.808
I'd choose the dog.

02:03:19.976 --> 02:03:23.312
Treasure!
There is a chest with jewels!

02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:25.689
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide!

02:03:25.857 --> 02:03:28.942
- You're making that up!
- Wait...

02:03:29.778 --> 02:03:33.447
I am with child. Yours.

02:03:34.699 --> 02:03:36.075
I don't recall that we ever had...

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:38.952
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.

02:03:39.120 --> 02:03:40.204
Wait!

02:03:42.123 --> 02:03:44.166
There is something I want to say to you.

02:03:44.334 --> 02:03:48.504
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

02:03:49.464 --> 02:03:50.547
Go on, then.

02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:54.218
I love you.

02:03:57.847 --> 02:03:59.640
As do I.

02:03:59.808 --> 02:04:03.227
Always have. Always will.

02:04:07.774 --> 02:04:09.233
I gotta go.

02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:10.400
Jack!

02:04:12.737 --> 02:04:14.321
This is not over!

02:04:15.406 --> 02:04:16.448
Jack!

02:04:26.042 --> 02:04:27.543
Missed!

02:04:42.851 --> 02:04:45.853
The Revenge is mine.

02:04:52.569 --> 02:04:53.986
Sir...

02:04:56.489 --> 02:04:58.323
We found this below decks.

02:05:24.434 --> 02:05:26.685
All hands!
Ply to windward!

02:05:26.853 --> 02:05:30.397
Get cracking,
ye blooming cockroaches!

02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:35.694
The Crown served me well.

02:05:35.862 --> 02:05:38.822
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...

02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:43.076
...make way for Tortuga!

02:05:54.214 --> 02:05:57.341
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
you made it!

02:05:57.508 --> 02:05:59.051
Aye!

02:05:59.219 --> 02:06:00.719
And I trust we managed a profit

02:06:00.887 --> 02:06:05.098
- from ourjoint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.

02:06:10.188 --> 02:06:12.689
The compass led me straight and true.

02:06:12.857 --> 02:06:14.816
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

02:06:14.984 --> 02:06:18.820
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.

02:06:18.988 --> 02:06:23.033
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

02:06:23.201 --> 02:06:25.244
Shame indeed.

02:06:37.215 --> 02:06:38.548
I hate that monkey.

02:06:38.716 --> 02:06:42.135
So, the Pearl...
Any idea how to get her out?

02:06:42.303 --> 02:06:45.305
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.

02:06:45.473 --> 02:06:48.475
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

02:06:49.018 --> 02:06:52.271
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.

02:06:54.941 --> 02:06:56.566
Jack, I have to ask...

02:06:56.734 --> 02:06:59.569
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

02:06:59.737 --> 02:07:02.239
You could have lived maybe forever.

02:07:02.407 --> 02:07:04.366
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

02:07:04.534 --> 02:07:07.411
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

02:07:07.578 --> 02:07:09.579
Every morsel of your entire being

02:07:09.747 --> 02:07:12.833
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

02:07:13.001 --> 02:07:15.502
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

02:07:15.670 --> 02:07:18.755
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.

02:07:18.923 --> 02:07:21.800
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

02:07:21.968 --> 02:07:23.927
It's a pirate's life for me.

02:07:24.887 --> 02:07:26.388
Savvy?
