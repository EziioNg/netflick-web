00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:16.141

none of us are too keen...

00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:38.788
on getting back into
one of those pods.

00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:45.629
Maybe we need to, um,
take a closer look.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:47.964
Hmm?

00:25:48.131 --> 00:25:50.175

00:25:53.303 --> 00:25:54.554
Okay, Ricks.

00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.807

and take a closer look.

<font color="#804040">RICKS:</font> Yes, sir.

00:26:00.644 --> 00:26:02.646

to you for a second?

00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:09.110
Are you sure about this?

00:26:09.653 --> 00:26:10.946
How do you mean?

00:26:11.613 --> 00:26:14.824
We've spent a decade
searching for Origae-6.

00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:16.910
We vetted it,
ran the simulations,

00:26:16.993 --> 00:26:18.203
and mapped the terrain.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.090
It's what we trained for.
I understand that.

00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:21.957
And now we're gonna
scrap all that...

00:26:22.123 --> 00:26:23.959
to chase
a rogue transmission?

00:26:25.335 --> 00:26:26.336
Think about it.

00:26:26.503 --> 00:26:27.504
A human being out there,

00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:28.869
where there
can't be any humans.

00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:31.341
A hidden planet that turns
up out of nowhere...

00:26:31.508 --> 00:26:33.635
and just happens
to be perfect for us.

00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:35.136
It's too good to be true.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.347
Too good to be true?
What do you mean by that?

00:26:37.514 --> 00:26:39.074
We don't know
what the fuck's out there.

00:26:39.182 --> 00:26:41.184
Maybe we just missed
the planet, Danny.

00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:44.020
This is a monumental risk
not worth taking.

00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:45.855
I'm not committing
to anything.

00:26:46.022 --> 00:26:47.458
I'm simply trying
to navigate the path

00:26:47.482 --> 00:26:49.025
as it unfolds before us.

00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:50.312
And this has
the potential...

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.071
to be a better habitat
for our colony.

00:26:53.238 --> 00:26:54.548
It has the potential.
We don't know that.

00:26:54.572 --> 00:26:56.157
By the way,
this crew...

00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:58.827
nobody wants to
get back in the pods.

00:26:59.369 --> 00:27:00.370
Right?

00:27:01.413 --> 00:27:03.748
And that was a human voice
in that transmission.

00:27:03.915 --> 00:27:06.418
And it's our responsibility
to investigate...

00:27:06.584 --> 00:27:08.336
It's our responsibility
to protect

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.714

on this ship.

00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:27.230

all the data available.

00:27:27.397 --> 00:27:28.565

carried a weapon.

Either kill them outright...

00:58:08.444 --> 00:58:10.905
