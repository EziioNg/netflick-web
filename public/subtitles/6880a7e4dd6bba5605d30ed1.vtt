WEBVTT

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.200
It prefers nobility to brutality.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.200
Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.040
History remembers the battle
and forgets the blood.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.880
Whatever history remembers of me,
if it remembers anything at all...

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.600
it shall only be
a fraction of the truth.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.760
For whatever else I am,
a husband, a lawyer...

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.400
a president...

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.560
I shall always think of myself
as a man who struggled against darkness.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.560
I leave in your trusted hands,
my dear friend Henry...

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.240
this record that begins
when I was just a boy.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.400
Get on down there. Hurry it up!

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.440
Please, sir, no.
There's been some kind of mistake.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.080
I ain't no slave.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.760
Let them go! Aaron!

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.840
Go back inside!

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.480
Let them go!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.640
Will!

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.320
-Quiet!
-He's my friend!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.600
Look away, Abraham.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.800
It's not our place.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.440
Look away.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.720
Abraham!

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.160
Thomas, help them!

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400
Leave him alone!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.120
Are you all right?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.640
Did you strike my friend here?

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.920
He was beating my son!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.520
Did you strike him, Lincoln?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.600
They're not slaves, and you know it.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.840
I suggest you get back to your work

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.880
before you find yourself
led away in chains.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.080
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.320
Very well, then.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.920
Since you're all
so concerned with freedom...

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.160
you may consider yourself free
from the burden of my employ.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.480
And the debt you've been working off...

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.840
I'd like it paid in full with interest.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680
Now, please.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.480
If you get one more penny
from me, Mr. Barts...

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.000
it will come with a fist
wrapped around it.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.520
All right, Mr. Lincoln.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.040
There are other ways to collect a debt.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.920
No!

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.880
What's happening to her, Father?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.760
Please help her!
Please, I beg of you.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.600
You've got to do something, Father.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.320
Easy, child.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.680
Look away, Abraham.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.800
I've never seen anything like this.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.400
Strange.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.240
You promise me.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.680
Let's step outside.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.320
I'm sorry, I don't know what ails her.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.400
Abraham.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.320
Come and lie next to me.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.200
I've been writing, Mama.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.320
"Days are swift as an Indian arrow...

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.000
"flying like a shooting star.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.840
"The present day is here...

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.520
"and then slides away in haste...

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.040
"that we can never say is ours...

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.000
"but only say...

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200
"is passed."

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.440
Mother?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.720
Mother?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.880
Mama once told me that
I hadn't cried when I was born.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.040
That I'd simply opened my eyes...

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.880
looked at her smiling face...
and smiled back.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.480
My light was gone.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.440
-I don't know how he did it--
-Abraham...

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.040
you promise me...

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.520
You promise me you won't go
and do anything foolish.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.240
Nine years later,
my father joined her in death.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.960
No longer bound by my promise...

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.080
I tried to fortify the nerve
to pursue my vengeance.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.560
Haven't you had enough?

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.920
A boy only gets this drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl...

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.480
or kill a man.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.080
Adam, let me explain.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.600
Last one, Barts.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.840
I'm not coming up here to clean up
your messes anymore.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.520
Yes, sir. I promise.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.720
Every so often, I think about what
it would be like to be in the South.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.720
So, where's Henry?

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.320
Yes, sir.
We've been looking all over, sir.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.800
Searching high and low.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.280
Low is more likely.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.000
Just find him, Barts.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.920
Oh, and send a fresh crop south.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.440
We have a lot of mouths to feed.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.800
Yes, sir.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.000
"Yes, sir, no, sir.
High, sir, low, sir."

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440
For my mother.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.240
That was unlucky.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.520
Might have put me out of my misery.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.200
Where the hell are you running to?

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.640
Don't much like chasing chickens.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.040
Little boy, all grown up.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.480
Come to avenge his dear momma.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.960
There are two kinds of men, Mr. Lincoln.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.320
Those that have the guts
to pull the trigger...

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.720
and those who do not.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.160
Powder, patch, ball.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.480
Don't mess it up.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.200
You weren't asleep that night.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.320
Were you?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.120
You dropped the ball, Mr. Lincoln.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.400
Your mama's blood was sickening sweet.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.480
I hope yours tastes better!

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.960
Might I suggest that we begin by...

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.800
closing the door?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.640
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.760
I didn't see anything!

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.240
Should we dive right in?

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.000
Or are you finding Gabrielle's
egress too distracting?

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.840
I'm sorry, sir, but who are you?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.240
Who I am is Henry Sturges.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.800
And where you are is my home.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.880
And what happened...

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.760
I saved your life...

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.880
during your rather pathetic attempt
at taking another's.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.520
What were you doing there, and...

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.520
how did you know
I would try to kill Barts?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.200
How?

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.800
I watched this boy carry out
his first long-awaited mission.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.240
Drunk, might I add.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.600
And I think, "You have wasted
your time watching this one, Henry.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.560
"He's not a promising recruit.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.800
"He is just a selfish boy
with his heart set on vengeance."

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.280
And I realized,
"This boy is a goddamned idiot!"

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.880
"I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire."

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:43.240
A vampire?

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.440
Yes. Immortal, blood-sucking demons.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.480
Fortunately for you, Mr. Lincoln...

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.600
hunting them is something of a hobby.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.240
But vampires are just myths.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.360
Myths don't beat you senseless

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.200
after you've put
a bullet in their brain.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.280
Thank you.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.720
No, Mr. Lincoln,
vampires are real.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.160
They exist in every city
and every state...

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.160
in the Union.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.720
If what you say is true,
you could help me kill him.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.200
I could pay you to kill him!

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.360
My services are not for sale.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.280
And the word you are looking for
is "destroy."

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.360
It is quite a feat to kill that
which is already dead.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.880
But you don't understand.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.240
My mother was murdered.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.240
And if I teach you how
to murder her murderer...

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.840
so what?

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.160
How will that honor her memory?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.840
How will that benefit the next boy
whose mother is taken?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.160
If vengeance is all you seek...

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.880
seek it elsewhere.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.160
Teach me to fight as you do.
Please, I'll do anything you say.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.160
You promise to cast aside
all notions of vengeance...

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.360
and commit to the life of a hunter?

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.520
You will have no friends...

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.000
no family.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.280
I told him what he wanted to hear...

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.000
but all I cared about was
killing the monster that took my mother.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.400
I'm in.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.680
Scottish Highland pistol.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.040
And if one barrel isn't enough...

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.960
seven should do you.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.280
The blunderbuss.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.360
And if you lose your ball...

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.240
you can always stuff your pocket watch
down the end of it.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.960
So, Abe...

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.800
which one takes your fancy?

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.880
Actually, I haven't had
the best of luck with shooting irons.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.680
But...

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.640
I was a rail splitter.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.160
I would like you to chop this tree down
with a single swing.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.720
That tree?

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.240
It's got to be more than a foot across.
That's impossible.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.720
But it isn't a tree.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.520
It's what you hate most in the world.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.160
So, tell me, Mr. Lincoln...

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.840
what do you hate?

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.200
I hate Jack Barts.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.640
Then strike him down.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.000
Well, clearly you don't
hate him that much.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.440
Tell me what you hate.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.400
I hate that my mother was taken away.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:29.760
Inadequate.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.640
I hate that we were afraid.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.840
And?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.560
That my mother and father,
everyone that we knew...

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.800
lived in fear.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.320
Pathetic.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.280
I hate that I was too small.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.280
-Too weak.
-Yes.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.120
-And that you failed...
-Yes!

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.480
-...to protect her.
-Yes!

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.480
And that you let her die.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.120
Power, Lincoln...

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.880
real power...

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.400
comes not from hate,
but from truth.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.640
Before you protect others
from darkness...

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.720
you must first be able
to protect yourself.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.080
Your enemies have the power
to render themselves invisible.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.680
You must have the ability
to fight blind.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.880
To see, without seeing.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.160
Again.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.360
In the weeks that followed...

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.120
Henry endeavored to impart a lifetime
of vampire-hunting secrets.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.280
Their ability to adapt to sunlight.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.200
Their power to render
themselves invisible.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.960
But most of all,
he taught me how to destroy them.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.400
When Judas betrayed Jesus...

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.320
his reward was 30 pieces of silver.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.240
At that moment, those pieces
became a symbol of betraying God.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.760
Of evil.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.680
And silver became a curse...

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.560
upon the cursed.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.560
You will never see a vampire
with silver on his person.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.040
Nor see them reflected in mirrors.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.080
The one thing God placed
beyond the reach of a vampire.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.080
The one thing he can never possess.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.160
Barts...

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.000
And the only thing that
renders him powerless.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.080
Henry, Jack Barts!

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.080
I give you the targets.
That was our deal.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.240
This is not only
about Jack Barts.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.760
Vadoma, a ruthless enforcer.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.040
And her brother.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.080
I've seen him before.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.040
I saw him with Jack Barts.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.520
They call him Adam.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.400
He, from whom all others are made.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.760
Vampires have been in
the New World for centuries.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.720
Slaughtering native tribes
and early settlers.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.800
But when the Europeans
arrived with their slaves...

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.760
the dead saw a sinister opportunity.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.640
They built an empire in the South.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.840
But, in recent years,
they pressed north...

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.960
leaving death in their wake.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.760
It falls to us, Abraham...

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.800
the hunters,
to keep the balance.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.440
To ensure that this remains
a nation of men...

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.480
and not monsters.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.640
What we do,
we do not for one man...

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.360
but for the good of all mankind.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.560
Henry sent me off into
the world with a reminder.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.120
No attachments.
No distractions.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.440
No friends or family.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.680
Besides, who could I trust?

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.040
Anyone in this well-mannered city
might very well be one of them.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.720
Son of a bitch!

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.680
I ever see you here again,
I will have your balls as a coin purse!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.840
Good afternoon, sir.
Joshua Speed at your service.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.520
Abraham... Lincoln.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:53.880
I need a bit of help.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.200
All right.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.080
Well, a friend in need,
is a friend of Speed.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.520
What can I get for you?

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.360
I don't suppose you know
of any rooms for rent, Mr. Speed?

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.680
What sort of room are
you looking for, Mr. Lincoln?

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720
Well, a cheap one...

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.280
as I have spent all of my money
on law books

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.560
and have none to spare at the moment.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.920
Now, as you say you have none,
am I to take your meaning as "cheap"...

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.080
or "free of charge"?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.400
Well, on credit.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.680
I don't think you'll find
such a room in Springfield.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.480
People here are strangely
accustomed to being compensated.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.880
Good day.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.480
There is one room, Mr. Lincoln.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.360
I was recently forced to part ways
with a thieving prick of an associate...

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.880
and am, therefore,
in need of a replacement.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.360
There's a room upstairs.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.880
It isn't much, but I suppose
it could be had on credit...

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.200
if the tenant were willing
to work here in return.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.960
Dear Henry...

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.240
life in Springfield is
less than desirous.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440
Fear not.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.080
My pittance of a salary doesn't allow me
to deviate from your rules...

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.280
No friends, no family.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.280
And certainly, no woman would find me,
and my existence, enticing.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.920
Excuse me.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.600
Excuse me,
I'll be needing these.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.120
Just one second, ma'am.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.520
Well, you needn't call me ma'am,
as if I'm some haggard spinster...

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.080
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.520
Madam... I mean, miss.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.480
I'm Abraham... Lincoln.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.720
Mary Todd.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.280
Darling.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.160
There you are.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.360
You mustn't flit from
store to store so quickly.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.320
Well, perhaps if you didn't stop to jaw
with every gentleman in Springfield...

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.800
I could say the same for you.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.120
Stephen Douglas.
How do you do?

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.160
Abraham... Lincoln.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.920
Are you a voting man, Mr. Lincoln?

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.320
I...

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.760
How do you feel about
keeping slavery out of Illinois?

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.120
I'm running for the legislature.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.120
I'm sure he'd love to hear
your campaign speech...

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.000
but Mr. Lincoln was just about
to attend to my list.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.760
We were talking, dear.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.760
Slavery, it's a complicated issue.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.640
I couldn't disagree with you more,
Mr. Douglas.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.840
Mr. Douglas, Miss Todd.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.760
You have met my new associate, Abraham.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.200
A letter came for you.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.920
Dear Abe.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.880
Your prescription awaits you
at the local pharmacy.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.520
Ask for Aaron Stibel, Junior.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.360
Mr. Lincoln?

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.720
I'm so sorry.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.200
Good day of work, Abraham.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.560
Thank you.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.200
But don't forget...

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.200
always have a contingency plan.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.000
Aaron Stibel Junior?

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200
Yes?

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.440
That's it. Oh, that's tight.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.760
Don't worry.
It will only hurt for a second or two.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.520
Did you eat today?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.640
I had killed a monster.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.640
And I would kill again.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.920
But no amount of death
could make me forget.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.240
Merciful Christ, Lincoln,
what happened to your face?

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.600
Don't worry, I'll still be able to work.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.680
Work?

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.240
To hell with work.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.560
We got invited to a ball.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.600
It could be your chance to save
Mary Todd from a life of boredom.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.440
This suit makes me look ridiculous.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.640
Nonsense.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.680
But that hat makes you look ridiculous.
Come on.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.680
Come on, come on.
Look, there she is.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.240
Mr. Douglas, Joshua Speed.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.240
Pleasure to see you.
Mary, you look lovely.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.520
He's still missing.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.600
Who's that?

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.760
Aaron Stibel.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.920
Junior or Senior?

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.760
Junior.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.320
-Who is that man?
-I don't know.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.560
Mr. Douglas, you know Senator Nolan,
of course.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.760
Yes, Stephen. Good to see you.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.920
Have you heard this news?

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.280
Yes, we're looking into it.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.320
Rest assured,
this kind of lawlessness...

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.040
won't stand
in the noble state of Illinois.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.640
It's called a dance.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.560
If we were meant to sit alone,
they would've called it something else.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.000
Yes, I suppose they would have.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.160
Come, Mr. Lincoln.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.720
You'll ruin the upholstery
if you sit there any longer.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.520
I'm sure you're a very nice man,
Mr. Lincoln...

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.720
but you're a...

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.560
A shopkeeper, in a borrowed suit.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.920
No, it's not a matter of means.
Really, no.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.080
I came to Springfield
looking for someone different.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.280
Someone whose life
was a bit more adventurous, and well...

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.280
My apologies, I'm never this--

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.320
Honest?

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.520
Rude.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.360
Miss Todd, may I speak candidly?

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.840
I, too, came here to better myself.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.000
That's why I've taken an interest
in the law...

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.840
and why, if I may be so bold,
I have taken an interest in you.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.080
And as for the adventure
that you seek...

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.200
I suspect that few men
could ever hope to provide that for you.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.280
Least of all your fiancГ©,
Stephen Douglas.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.360
Mr. Lincoln, you are full of surprises.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.320
Miss Todd, you have no idea.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.400
Dear Abraham.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.200
I've made a deposit at the local bank.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.040
Be careful, it can quickly disappear.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.280
Henry, there are more
than I ever thought possible.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.720
Pharmacists, innkeepers, pastors.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.240
It's more than a man can bear.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.320
Well, I see I'm
such interesting company.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.400
I'm sorry.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.440
I've been working nights.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.920
Really? Is that true?

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.800
Do you really want
to know the truth, Mary?

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.400
Each and every night...

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.200
I go out...

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.120
hunting vampires.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.280
Well, how do you hunt these vampires?

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.800
With an axe.

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.120
A special silver axe, of course.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.400
Of course.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.720
And how many would
you reckon you've killed?

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.880
Five. No... six.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.400
I have killed six vampires.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.640
My goodness!

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.560
Abe!

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.320
Here I thought you were an honest man.
Really!

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.320
Well, I had a wonderful day, Abe.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.240
As did I, Mary.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.360
Miss Todd, you are a woman
of ravishing resourcefulness.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.800
Mr. Lincoln, you have no idea.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.160
You will have no friends, no family.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.320
I... should be going. It's late.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.880
How could I bring her into this world?

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.880
A world of demons, of danger.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.520
Good night, then, Lincoln.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.680
Good night, Mary.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.040
Happy hunting.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.440
If I truly cared for her...

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.360
the kindest thing I could do...

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.080
was walk away.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.280
This hunter
is another of Henry's disciples?

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.800
They say he's a madman.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.800
I can't wait to meet him.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.000
A stock boy, reading a law book.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.280
What?
You studying to be a lawyer?

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.760
As a matter of fact, I am.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.000
All right, what about a little test?

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.960
What's the law for free slaves
in the North?

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.560
According to the
Fugitive Slave Act of 1793...

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.520
enforcing Article four, section two,
of the United States Constitution...

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.680
"All runaway slaves must
be returned to their owners."

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.360
However,
personal liberty laws state that...

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.040
"Anyone who is born free...

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.960
"cannot be taken under this act."

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.840
I heard a good woman once say...

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.960
"Until all men are free...

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.680
"we're all slaves."

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.960
Will?

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.600
Will Johnson!

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.960
How did you...?

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.600
I was back home...

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.160
and heard you moved here.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.080
Studying to be a lawyer.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.960
That's good.
I'm in need of a good lawyer.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.840
What, are you in some kind of trouble?

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.440
I was freeing slaves down South
on the railroad...

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.680
hoping to find my brother down there.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.680
Some bounty hunters got after me.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.880
Said I was a runaway.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.960
I need a writ, Abe...

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.520
saying I was born free.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.640
You know, Will...

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.120
Come on.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.680
Hey.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.920
Speed, this is Will Johnson.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.960
Will Johnson,
my oldest friend in the world.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.640
The store isn't
going to run itself, Abe.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.720
I'll have him back
as soon as possible, Mr. Speed.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.040
I promise.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.720
You're getting tall, Abe.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.960
Look like you still
don't eat much, either.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.880
You still afraid of the dark, too?

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.760
Not so much anymore.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.800
That's him, Abe.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.240
That's the guy that's been chasing me.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.720
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen...

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.440
I'm sure we can work this out.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.000
Now I suggest you walk away, son.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.240
No, sir, I suggest you do.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.880
I've sent word to Senator Nolan.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.800
He'll have you out soon.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.320
You're far too kind, Miss Todd.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.520
And he's far too ugly
to have a woman like you.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.440
I think common-looking people
are the best in the world.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.240
That's why the Lord
makes so many of them.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.600
I just thank God he was there.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.360
But I won't always be there.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.880
Mary...

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.440
what if something was going on,
something terrible...

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.680
and you knew that there was no way
on earth that one man could stop it?

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.320
What would you do?

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.040
Well...

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.240
I wouldn't back away from what's right
just because it's hard.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.800
My father used to say,
"Plant your feet and stand firm.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.240
"The only question is
where to put your feet."

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.280
We may fail in this fight.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.360
We may only shatter
the tranquil veil of oppression...

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.960
but we must not be deterred!

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.120
For ours is a just and noble cause.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.800
The cause of freedom.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.960
The very cause upon which
our founding fathers built...

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.160
this great nation!

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.840
A voice like that is too strong
to be stuck keeping shop.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.120
I'm actually studying to be a lawyer.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.920
Well, Mr. Lincoln, maybe it's time
you thought about politics.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.520
I can connect you with the right people.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.480
Thank you, Senator Nolan.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.920
-A pleasure young man.
-The same.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
You're on your way, Mr. Lincoln.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.760
I sent you to Springfield
to hunt vampires...

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.160
not to chase votes.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.360
Lesson one,
always have a contingency plan.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.880
If vampire hunting doesn't pan out...

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.400
I need a career to fall back on.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.920
I'm being serious.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.840
So am I, Henry.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.160
I have done everything
you've asked of me.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.360
Every letter, every name...

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.240
but never the letter I wait for,
and never the name I want most.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.040
When do I get to kill Jack Barts?

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.480
Barts knows about Mary.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.720
It's time.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.960
Abraham...

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.480
Be careful.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.920
Abraham-fucking-Linc--

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.080
Missed again!

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.680
I hope you're better with an axe
than you were with a gun.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.000
Come on, Lincoln!

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.000
Catch me before I get to Mary.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.720
Catch me if you can, boy!

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.520
There's thousands of us here.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.320
He won't stop until
this whole country is ours.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.360
And they be coming for you now.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.080
Ask your friend, Henry.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.640
You shut your mouth, you stupid whore.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:58.480
Give me what I need,
or I'll knock your teeth out.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.440
You lying son of a bitch.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.680
God damn it!

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.200
No, Abe, stop!

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.920
You weren't ready to know.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.720
What, that you are a vampire?

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.840
You are not the only one...

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.520
who has lost everything to vampires.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.720
Just because the carriage stops...

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.840
doesn't mean we have to.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.600
Get in the carriage.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.080
Take this.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.480
Run. Just run.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.840
Henry!

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.000
Her soul was pure.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:19.440
But yours, Henry...

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.960
It's one of God's little tricks.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.240
Vampires cannot kill their own kind.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.440
Only the living can kill the dead.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.640
Welcome to the family.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.440
You can't save the world,
and the ones you love, Lincoln.

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.800
You need to make a choice.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.440
I'm sorry...

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.360
but goodbye.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.440
Abe!

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.840
Mary!

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.360
What on earth are you doing?

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.440
Come on in.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.120
-What are you hiding?
-Nothing.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.160
Abe?

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.680
It's nothing.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.080
Abe, I know when you're lying.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.480
What are you hiding from me?

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.800
All right.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:20.000
I didn't want to tell you this way.
This is not the way that I planned it.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.640
But if you really must know...

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.320
Mary Todd...

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.440
will you make me the happiest of men?

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.360
And do you, Abraham...

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:13.280
promise to love her,
comfort her...

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.560
be honorable and honest
with her in all things...

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.520
in sickness and health...

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.800
till death do you part?

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.840
I do.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.440
Then by the power vested
in me by almighty God...

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:28.080
in the great state of Illinois...

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.440
I now pronounce you...

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.440
man and wife.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.000
You may kiss the bride.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.160
Your mother would be so proud.

00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.240
Thank you, Will.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.640
I'm happy you could be here.

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.360
You're the only family I have.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.920
Except for this one.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.040
Congratulations.

00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:57.240
May I introduce Mr. Henry Sturges.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.120
My wife, Mary.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.840
And my dear friend, Will Johnson.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.400
Heavens, Mr. Sturges,
you're as chilly as the winter wind.

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.800
Henry, please.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:07.840
I'm afraid that's a hazard
of carrying one's own bottle.

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.560
Well, you know what they say,
"Cold hands, warm heart."

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.040
Yes, but I highly doubt that.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.840
Mr. Sturges is a business associate.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.760
Yes, I thought we
could talk a little business.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:17.840
Of course.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.280
If you'll excuse me.

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.720
What the hell are you doing here?

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.520
Be cautious, Abraham.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.480
One forgets how easily we can lose
the most precious things.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.680
They don't even know who I am.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.760
Go upriver.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.360
Invite this Mr. Lincoln
to join us at the plantation.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:28.320
We're going to throw a ball
in his honor.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.880
What makes you think he'll accept?

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.840
I think we can find a way to tempt him.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.160
It's a good book. It's good.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.440
Get him!

00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.680
Abe.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.840
We've got a problem.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.160
They took Will.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.160
What are you going to do?

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.320
I'm going to accept his invitation.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:22.040
Speed deserved to know the truth
of what we were about to face.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.840
I told him everything.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.880
Not knowing if he would believe me
or think me mad.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.160
Not knowing if he would have the courage
to face the monsters...

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.400
that I had come to know.

00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:36.600
You and me, Abraham,
together we can accomplish anything.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.880
There are no slaves.
Where are they?

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.200
I was just wondering that.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.360
Something isn't right about this, Abe.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.400
Yeah.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.600
I don't know how to dance.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.440
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.080
Wait here.

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:55.760
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:57.720
dinner is served.

00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.720
Bravo, Mr. Lincoln.

00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.080
Bravo.
You're even better than I'd heard.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.480
A shame to sacrifice
so many of my best men...

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.400
but I needed to know
if you're up to the task.

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.080
What do you want with me?

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.080
To see you liberated.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.240
To see you rise up
and destroy your oppressor.

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.760
That's interesting advice,
coming from a slave owner.

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.280
Men have enslaved each other...

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:21.560
since they invented gods
to forgive them for doing it.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.160
I've seen Jews build Egypt's glory.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.480
Seen Christians...

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:36.040
thrown to lions with my own eyes.

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.680
And I've seen Africans
sell their own kind to Europeans.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:46.760
May I share one of the revelations
of my 5,000 years?

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:50.520
We're all slaves to something.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.880
I, to eternity.

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.240
You, to your convictions.
Others, to the color of their skin.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.200
All I ever wanted...

00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.080
was to see my kind
granted their rightful place.

00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:07.280
But there are those of us,
those like your friend Henry...

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.000
who enjoy living in the dark.

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.280
And as you're doubtless aware...

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.520
I cannot personally destroy him,
nor he I.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.920
You, Mr. Lincoln...

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.800
you could eliminate those
last pockets of resistance...

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.680
beginning with Henry Sturges himself.

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.440
All I ask...

00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:34.720
is for you to break your chains.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.560
Kill your master.

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:39.480
Be free.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.880
And if I refuse?

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.720
Then you go on your merry way.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.920
After I make you one of us, and...

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.440
spoon-feed you your friend.

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.440
Now, a simple "yes" or "no"
will suffice.

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.240
Kill Henry...

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.680
save your friend.

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.560
Feel free to take your time to decide.
Five...

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:08.840
four...

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.040
three...

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:12.680
two...

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.720
one.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.840
Come on!

00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.760
This way.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.520
Miss Tubman, Miss Tubman.
We've been waiting for you.

00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:25.920
Come quickly.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.680
People getting killed every day.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.600
Slaves disappearing.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.120
Some people talk
about monsters and demons.

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.720
Good morning.
Good morning.

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.280
How can I assist you
on this beautiful day?

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.800
We're looking for three men.

00:59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.280
You know, I did see someone
run down that way.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.640
You're welcome to come in if you like.

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.480
Our service is about to begin.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.000
Right, let's keep going.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I take it y'all came from up North?

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.520
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.320
Well, I suggest you get back there
as fast as you can.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.680
There's a war coming.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.680
A war for the soul of the country.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.680
Going to be all colors of blood spilled.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.000
Our nation was built
on the backs of slaves.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.280
Their labor, their blood.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.200
More blood than
you could possibly imagine.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:50.080
I have seen this
horror of the South firsthand.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.200
I say the need for peace
outweighs the needs of the Blacks.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.920
I say that if the people
of this great nation want slavery...

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.640
then let them have it.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.480
The demon of slavery
is tearing our country apart.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.760
We must stand up.
We must stand strong and fight.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.680
Fight for the very soul of our nation.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.440
Until every man is free,
we are all slaves!

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.720
You cannot take on slavery, Abraham.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.560
You cannot take on the whole South!

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.200
-Why, because of Adam?
-No.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.680
Are you afraid of him?

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.680
Because it is the only thing that has
kept them sated for all these years...

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.920
and you take that away,
then no one is safe.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.280
So you get to choose
who lives and who dies.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400
A great man once said...

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.240
"What we do,
we do not for ourselves...

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.720
"not for one man,
but for the good of all mankind!"

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.880
Not all mankind, Abraham.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.320
Abe?

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.640
May I have my husband back?

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.600
He's all yours, Mrs. Lincoln.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.680
Henry only saw the struggle his way.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.840
But I began at last to see it another.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.520
To see and to feel
the even greater issues at stake.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.240
So, he and I would go our separate ways.

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:13.600
As the Bible says...

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.200
the time had come for me
to put aside childish things.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.760
I would fight not with an ax...

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.000
but with words and ideals.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.880
For a time...

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.320
they proved a stronger weapon.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.480
Lincoln! Lincoln! Lincoln!

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.840
I appear before you to take,
in your presence...

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.200
the oath prescribed by
the Constitution of the United States...

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.320
to be taken by the president...

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.960
before he enters on
the execution of this office.

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:04.960
The question of slavery is better settled
with a pen than with a sword.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.200
Fire!

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.160
Through twists of fate...

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.520
I found myself at 50 years of age...

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:32.160
the father of a nation that
was tearing itself apart...

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.600
while trying to be
the father to a boy...

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.000
not much older than I was
when I lost my mother.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.040
3,000 more dead.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.680
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.120
I'm not hungry, thank you.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.520
You have got to eat, Abe.
You're only human.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.120
Come along, Willie.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.400
Willie.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.160
Willie.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:39.400
If you do this,
there is no turning back, Abe.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.080
I know.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.920
I'm trying to protect the freedom
of a nation.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.080
If this war is truly a stand
against evil...

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.640
then let it stand for something.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.040
If it is a war for the freedom of man...

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.240
why not give all men
a reason to fight it?

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.560
"All persons held as slaves...

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.600
"within any state
or designated part of a state...

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.920
"the people whereof
shall be in rebellion

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.560
"against the United States
shall be then..."

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.360
"...and henceforward shall be free."

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.800
Good morning.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:38.200
Precious little one...

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.360
what's your name?

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.440
Willie.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.680
And your father? What's his?

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.640
Abraham.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.640
What a beautiful silver sword.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.040
How is our little soldier faring?

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.640
I've never seen anything like it.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.880
I'm sorry.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.600
I don't know what ails your boy.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.480
Abe.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.200
Mary's calling for you.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.120
I'm so sorry, Abraham.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.040
Why didn't they take me?

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.400
Because they know...

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.200
it is a fate much worse than death.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.280
Mary...

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.080
is inconsolable.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.640
She says she doesn't want
to go on without him.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.280
There is a way, Abraham.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.040
You know that I can restore the dead.

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:11.600
Do it.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320
Do it.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.720
Mary...

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200
Do it!

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.440
Your journal...

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.040
the one you always
kept in your coat pocket...

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.160
I know I shouldn't have, Abe, but
I needed to know what you were hiding.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.840
If what you say is true...

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.680
I beg you...

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.160
give us our little boy back.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.040
Mary, he wouldn't be our little boy.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.000
He would be something else,
something terrible.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.840
Trust me, you don't want that.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
You're asking me to trust you?

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.680
After you lied to me
for all these years.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.360
I did it to protect you,
to protect our family.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.600
And how did that work out?

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.680
You did this, Abe!

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.040
You did this!
You brought this on him!

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.800
You brought this on our boy!

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.400
Let me go to them.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.480
Make a truce with Adam.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.320
We must stop this war.
Willie's death is just the beginning.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.200
Don't you dare say his name.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.200
I warned you.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.840
You didn't heed me.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.360
How many more boys will have to die
before you listen to me?

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.680
These boys are dying in vain.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.600
We should pull the troops back.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:47.200
Abraham,
this war has cost us countless lives...

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.200
not to mention millions of dollars.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.920
I thought we were going
to make this country great...

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.760
not tear it apart.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.560
This is the only way
we can save the country now, Speed.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.280
Send in troops.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.240
Union troops are flooding
onto the field.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.080
We are now outnumbered...

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.320
and ill-equipped compared to the North.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.720
We will support you...

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.400
but you will need to support us.

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.120
No, thank you.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.440
Rest assured, Mr. Davis...

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.120
you'll have as many of my kind
as you need.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.640
Fire!

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.480
Fire!

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.000
Ready!

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.480
Aim!

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.440
Here they come!

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.560
Fire!

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.920
Why did they drop their rifles?

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.840
Fire!

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.880
It's the first day of Gettysburg.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.040
It's been a disaster.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.680
I don't think the army
can survive another.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.560
If the rebels break through,
they'll be here... in days.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.240
The generals think
we should evacuate Washington.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.400
Run the war from New York or...

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:48.880
Boston, if need be.

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.920
You have to win this war.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.440
If you don't, then all of it...

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:59.080
Then our son's death
will have been for nothing.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.040
How can I win a war...

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.400
when I can't even protect my own family?

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:07.000
Our men have no way of defending
themselves against this enemy.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.840
When our bullets are useless,
our bayonets are powerless as this fork!

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:13.160
This...

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.120
Will!

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.320
Speed!

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.120
This. This is what we need.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.720
A fork.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.280
Silver.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.480
Okay, okay.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.720
How much do we need?

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.880
All of it.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.680
And why tell me this, Mr. Speed?

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.320
Why betray your friend?

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.080
He is my friend,
but I love this country even more.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:10.720
And he, more than anyone, is responsible
for tearing this nation apart.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.160
You've done the right thing.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.160
I know.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.840
32, 33, 34, 35...

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.280
That is a lot of silver, Abe.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.600
Now, how are we going to
get all this there?

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.880
I'm sorry, Mary.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.480
I'm sorry I've kept you in the dark
all these years.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:10.040
I need you, Mary.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.920
I've waited a long time
to hear you say those words.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.000
I want you to leave Washington, Mary.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.480
Miss Tubman,
please have some tea.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.200
I very much appreciate you coming
to speak with me today.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.760
Oh, yes.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.080
Things have not been easy,
what with my...

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.800
The death of my son and the war.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.840
I need to get out of Washington.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.720
And I need a lot of help.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.920
This war ends tonight.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:08.760
And with it...

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.760
our millennia of darkness.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.200
We have to do this on our own.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.120
No one can know what's on that train.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.920
If we don't get those weapons
to those boys at Gettysburg...

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.200
the war is over.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:29.360
It's time we had a nation of our own.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.600
Come...

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.480
we have a train to catch.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.760
It's 80 miles from here to Gettysburg.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.600
Eighty miles will decide whether
this nation belongs to the living...

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.800
or the dead.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:17.640
Is everything all right, Speed?

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.800
I just can't believe
you're still writing in that book.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.120
It's all in here, Speed.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.640
The good with the bad.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.040
What's this?

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:51.400
They're fleeing the nest.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.320
Leaving Washington free for us.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.160
Look at me.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.480
I said look at me.

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:16.040
Leave her.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.360
Don't want to miss this train.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600
Let's go.

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.160
Henry, what the hell are you doing here?

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.560
I just wanted to see
how far your foolishness would take you.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.840
I don't have time to argue!

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.040
I didn't come here to argue with you.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:59.920
I came here to tell you that
your dear friend Speed back there...

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.280
is a traitor.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.520
He betrayed you, Abe.
Speed is leading you--

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.440
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.680
That's all according to plan.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.000
You must get off this train.

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.040
No, you must get off this train.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:09.160
This is not your war, Henry.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.040
They're here, Abe.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.240
A whole heap of them.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.120
We can't let them stop this train.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.640
You go through there
and you're dead.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.080
Get out now,
it's your last chance.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:04.640
Did you load that thing?

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.200
We've got to keep them
away from the locomotive.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.720
Why don't you let him go, Lincoln?

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:15.000
Emancipate yourselves.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.680
I will never follow you.

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.080
You don't have to follow me, Abe.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.080
I have the train.

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.720
I have the silver.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.160
Soon I'll have the whole country.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:29.360
I'm going to destroy
the myth of Abraham Lincoln...

01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.160
so that history will forever know you
not as a man...

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.600
but as a monster!

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.760
Lincoln set us up.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.000
We've been tricked, Adam.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.480
There is no silver on this train.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:06.400
Abe!

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.800
Abe!

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:20.000
Abe!

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.480
Hello, Speed.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.400
Where is the silver?

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:38.440
Silver?

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:41.160
Should be here.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.880
Why did you lie to me?

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.440
To get you all in one place...

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:47.800
to finish you.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.240
Speed?

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.640
No!

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.400
Mr. President!

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:59.160
There is nowhere left to run, Lincoln.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.360
Where is it?

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.000
Where is the silver?

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.800
Right here!

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:54.640
Thank you, Henry.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:32:00.760
I suppose some vampires can be trusted.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.800
As can some men, Abraham.

01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:07.480
If the train was a decoy...

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.880
where is the silver?

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.960
This isn't the only railroad.

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:18.120
A wise man once taught me...

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.520
always have a contingency plan.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.200
Get me more!

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.600
Bayonets.
Bayonets for Springfield muskets.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.240
Springfield muskets!

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:35.680
Five-pounders and grenades are in
the second wagon in the back.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.080
Go now, go now.

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:35.080
Fire!

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.600
Four score and seven years ago...

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.880
our fathers brought forth
on this continent...

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.800
a new nation conceived in liberty...

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.280
and dedicated to the proposition...

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:02.520
that all men are created equal.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.320
Now we are engaged
in a great civil war...

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.880
testing whether that nation
or any nation...

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:12.560
so conceived and so dedicated...

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.920
can long endure.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.120
It is for us, the living, rather...

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.120
to be dedicated here...

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:28.920
to the unfinished work
which they who fought here...

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.720
have thus far so nobly advanced.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.400
It is rather for us
to be here dedicated...

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:38.800
to the great task remaining before us...

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.080
that from these honored dead we take
increased devotion to that cause...

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:47.080
for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion...

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:50.600
that we here highly resolve
that these dead...

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.680
shall not have died in vain...

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:56.720
and that this nation, under God...

01:34:56.880 --> 01:34:59.600
shall have a new birth of freedom...

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.920
and that government...

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:06.200
of the people, by the people,
for the people...

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:10.040
shall not perish from the earth.

01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:26.840
Our enemies have made their exodus.

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:29.000
Some back to Europe...

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:32.280
some to South America and the Orient.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.120
They've seen that America shall
forever be a nation of living men...

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.120
a nation of free men.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.200
We make rather a good team,
you and I.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:49.200
One can't help but think of all the good
we could do if we had more time.

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.440
Limitless time.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:52.520
Lincoln!

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:57.360
Yes, well, time waits for no man.

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.560
We're going to be late for the theatre.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.760
Hold onto this for me, Henry.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.800
Mary, darling...

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:17.400
have you seen my hat?

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.880
It's on your desk in the office.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:24.000
Have you seen my hat?

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.920
Abraham, let me make you immortal.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.720
Let us fight through the ages,
side by side.

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.160
Vampires are not
the only things that live forever.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.080
History prefers legends to men.

01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.960
It prefers nobility to brutality.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.280
Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.

01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.440
History remembers the battle...

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.440
and forgets the blood.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.960
However history remembers me,
if it does at all...

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:15.440
it shall only remember
a fraction of the truth.

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.680
One more.

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.360
A guy only gets that drunk when
he wants to kiss a girl or kill a man.

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.640
So, which is it?
