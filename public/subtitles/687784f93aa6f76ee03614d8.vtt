WEBVTT

00:02:58.846 --> 00:02:59.846
Don't.

00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.098
Calm down.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.683
Hey, fuck you.

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:05.685
Calm down.

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:07.603
Fuck you.

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.953
Looks like
his chute didn't open.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.350
Single shooter.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.561
How do you know?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.545
Please stop doing that.

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:23.179
You're shooting at
the wrong people.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.515
How do l know?

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:31.520
Because otherwise,
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.865
All right.

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:45.076
You wanna show me
the right ones?

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.207
Nikolai.

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.542
l mean, l'm Nikolai.

00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:00.383
What's the last thing
you remember, Nikolai?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.595
War. Yeah.

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:06.138
l was with the Chechnya.

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:09.558
And there was a light.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:12.895
And then l. . .
Then l woke up
and l was. . .

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.563
Falling.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.567
Yeah, same thing.
I was in Baja.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.569
And then
there was a light.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.780
And then ch ingao.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:33.499
Where are we?

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.586
Maybe she knows.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.090
Shit.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.597
You wanna
lower the weapon?

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:53.269
I've never seen
this jungle.

00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:55.938
And I've seen most.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.275
All right, you think
this is Asia?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:00.860
Maybe Africa?

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:03.320
Too hot for
this time of year.

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.781
And the topography
is all wrong.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.451
Amazon, maybe.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.953
I saw more parachutes.

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.539
Which way?

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.291
Why?

00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:24.050
So I can figure out
who threw me out of
a fucking airplane.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.310
Fuck.
Where's he going?

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:40.316
All right, let's hit
the fucking road.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.077
Fuck.

00:07:36.456 --> 00:07:38.624
You remember a plane?

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.504
I woke up in freefall.

00:07:43.755 --> 00:07:45.381
You?

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:47.883
Same.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.262
You're IDF?

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:52.638
Yeah.

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:54.723
Are you in
the service?

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:57.059
Not exactly.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.229
You motherfucker.

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.982
Come on,
you motherfucker.

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:21.834
You with him?

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:22.960
No.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:31.135
Then why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:34.513
We have
bigger problems
right now.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.809
Okay, boss.
Whatever you say.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:45.232
I will finish
what you started.

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:53.449
Strength in numbers, huh?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.367
Something like that.

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.452
Yeah?

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.288
Maybe we should
get that guy
hanging in the tree?

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:01.790
Help me!

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.334
Fuck!

00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:06.795
Help me! Somebody!

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.549
Fuck. Help!

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.053
Hello?

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.931
I'm trapped in a parachute
in a fucking tree.

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.599
Hey, man,
why don't you
shut the fuck up?

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.643
Oh. Thank God.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.311
I think I can. . .

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.480
Stop moving.
You're breaking
the branch.

00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.191
You have anything
to cut yourself
down with?

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.026
Why would I. . .
No, I don't.

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.111
Look, if we get rope
from one of the chutes. . .

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:32.321
Do something.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:39.286
Help!

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:40.913
It was taking too long.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.665
Help!

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.464
Who the hell are you?

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.008
I'm a doctor.

00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.761
I was on
my way to work.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:00.266
Can someone please
just tell me, uh,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.062
what the fuck
is going on here?

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.052
Your ass is awesome.

00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:48.605
Look.

00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:58.157
Goddamn.
Who the hell
is this guy?

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.717
What the hell
is that?

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.104
Who would do this?

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.067
Whoever they are,
they take trophies.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:36.111
In my culture

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.489
the warrior with
the greatest trophies

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:40.115
commands
the most respect.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:42.242
Whatever.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:45.996
It's a test.

00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.917
To see how we do
under pressure.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.879
If this were a test,
you'd all be military.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.255
Total strangers.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.091
Live rounds.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:11:59.760
This is something else.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.762
Maybe it's ransom.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.100
Back in Tijuana,
we kidnap you,

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:08.435
put you in
an oil drum.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.105
The ransom's not paid,

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:14.149
we light you on fire.

00:12:14.234 --> 00:12:16.402
I hear these stories

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:18.862
about these experiments
they run on cons.

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.280
They stick drugs
in your food

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.324
and they sit back
and watch what happens.

00:12:22.492 --> 00:12:24.076
Well, it's not drugs.

00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:26.537
If it was
a psychotropic compound,

00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:28.330
we'd be feeling
the residual side effects.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.167
Loss of motor skills,
blurry vision.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.797
And if it was
a behavioral experiment. . .
I mean, there. . .

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.340
There'd be a point.

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.220
What if we are dead?

00:12:49.853 --> 00:12:51.937
I was going to be
executed in two days.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.772
And I was in combat.

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:56.859
So was I.

00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.611
This is hell.

00:12:59.946 --> 00:13:02.739
Last time I looked,
you didn't need
a parachute to get there.

00:13:04.284 --> 00:13:06.535
It doesn't matter
what happened, or why.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.829
We're here.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:13.542
Only question is,
how do we get out?

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.464
Where you going?

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:20.340
To high ground.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.050
We need to
stick together.

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.889
Then you should
follow me.

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:06.553
Uh, yeah,
I wouldn't do that.

00:14:14.437 --> 00:14:15.729
Yep.

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:19.441
Archaefructus
liaoningensis.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.611
That is really,
really poisonous.

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:24.780
Wouldn't take more
than one scratch

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.990
to cause
total paralysis.

00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:34.289
Thank you.
I'll watch for you
out here.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:39.294
You made a buddy.

00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:49.596
Hey.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.558
We need to rest.

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.644
So rest.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.314
You look like
you could use it, too.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.819
You got a name?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.533
Look.

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.911
I'm sorry.
You want to play
scout leader, great.

00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:15.706
All right? You wanna
follow me, fine.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.791
But I'm not doing this.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:20.460
I'm better on my own.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.214
Wanna see
something fucked up?

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:48.655
Well, between that
and the sun,

00:15:49.741 --> 00:15:51.783
I'd say we have
a real problem.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.619
What about the sun?

00:15:55.121 --> 00:15:56.997
Hasn't moved
since we got here.

00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:06.089
What do you think
is really going on?

00:16:09.677 --> 00:16:11.553
What do I think?

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:16.266
Spetsnaz.

00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:18.101
Alpha Group.

00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:21.271
Los Zetas,
cartel enforcer.

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:23.649
RUF.

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:26.318
It's a death squad
from Sierra Leone.

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.779
Yakuza, Inagawa-kai.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:31.948
And the FBI's
Most Wanted.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:35.160
And him.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:39.748
They're all
heavy-hitters.
He doesn't belong.

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.334
Belong to what?

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.839
I'd say we were chosen.

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:54.971
What about you?

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.100
What about me?

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:05.023
You know the jungle.
Know the players.

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:10.028
I'm guessing ex-military.
Black ops.

00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:12.906
Probably a mercenary.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.991
You got a problem
with that?

00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:20.580
Not at the moment.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.875
Good.

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:08.355
Something was
dropped here.

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:11.233
Same as us.

00:19:13.361 --> 00:19:14.861
Not the same as us.

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.620
You said
we were chosen.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:27.874
Chosen for what?

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.295
Oh, shit.

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:07.706
Looking good there, boss.

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:15.505
Look out!

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.673
Down !

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.511
Shit!

00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:42.741
Help!

00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:43.825
Shit.

00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:55.962
Damn it.

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.577
1 2 o'clock.
1 1 0 meters.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:29.496
Take him. Take him.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.331
I don't have to.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:36.044
Don't have to.

00:21:43.177 --> 00:21:45.679
We triggered
a dead man's trap.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:52.936
It's two weeks, judging from
the rate of decomposition.

00:21:54.063 --> 00:21:55.563
He took up
a position here.

00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:01.736
Shooting in all directions.

00:22:02.363 --> 00:22:04.406
This was a last stand.

00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:14.290
United States
Special Forces.

00:22:15.126 --> 00:22:16.543
This is strange.

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:20.588
He is supposed
to be deployed
in Afghanistan.

00:22:21.132 --> 00:22:23.425
What's he doing here,
setting traps for us?

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:25.802
They weren't meant for us.

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:29.097
He was hunting
something else.

00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:31.016
Something a lot bigger.

00:22:31.308 --> 00:22:32.892
Bigger?

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:35.854
The trunk was a deadfall.

00:22:35.938 --> 00:22:37.397
Rule of thumb
with a deadfall

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.483
is you set the weight
five times that of
the target animal.

00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:43.945
Whatever it was,
it got through
the trip wires.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.780
And it did this.

00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:52.912
Let's move.

00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:15.852
What is it?

00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:19.314
What is it?

00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.365
Nothing.

00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:44.339
What is it?
Nothing. Nothing.

00:23:44.965 --> 00:23:45.965
Nothing.

00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:58.204
We're gonna need
a new plan.

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:19.642
Hey, where are we going?

00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:22.020
Someone put us
on this rock.

00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:24.522
There's got to be
a way off it.

00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:27.734
What the fuck?

00:25:32.781 --> 00:25:35.200
You know what?
Fuck this.

00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:36.993
This is bullshit, man.

00:25:37.077 --> 00:25:38.620
I want a gun.

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:41.331
Come on, man,
you got two
motherfucking guns, man.

00:25:41.415 --> 00:25:43.124
Somebody give me a gun.

00:25:43.792 --> 00:25:47.921
Come on, Russian.
You got a big fucking gun.

00:25:52.259 --> 00:25:53.259
Come on, man.

00:25:53.802 --> 00:25:55.720
Give me a gun.

00:25:56.639 --> 00:25:58.765
Give me your gun.
Right now.

00:26:00.476 --> 00:26:02.101
Give me your gun.

00:26:08.651 --> 00:26:10.818
I'm ready to die.

00:26:12.613 --> 00:26:14.155
Are you?

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.604
Oh.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.237
Help!

00:27:44.955 --> 00:27:47.749
Oh, shit!

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.168
Oh.

00:27:51.045 --> 00:27:52.211
Shit! Fuck!

00:28:11.106 --> 00:28:12.106
Help!

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:17.945
Fuck you ! Fuck you !

00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:26.371
Looking good there, boss.

00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:42.720
Go! Go!

00:28:42.805 --> 00:28:44.639
Come on. Come on.

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:55.483
Oh, shit!

00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:05.535
Come on !

00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:09.705
No!

00:29:40.904 --> 00:29:43.030
As bad as you are,

00:29:44.408 --> 00:29:46.492
those things are worse.

00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:07.889
So they. . .
They just,
what, left?

00:30:09.099 --> 00:30:10.183
No.

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.018
The whistle.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.228
They were called.

00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:16.647
All right, listen up.

00:30:16.732 --> 00:30:18.941
Everybody do
a shell count.

00:30:20.068 --> 00:30:21.486
We got to
conserve ammunition.

00:30:22.571 --> 00:30:24.405
Reload. Do it now.

00:30:24.907 --> 00:30:28.493
Excuse me.
Just what the hell
is going on here?

00:30:29.786 --> 00:30:31.287
We're being hunted.

00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:38.211
The cages.
The soldier.
All of us.

00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:42.423
All brought here
for the same purpose.

00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:46.802
This planet is
a game preserve.

00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:49.388
And we're the game.

00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:55.436
In case you didn't notice,

00:30:55.521 --> 00:30:58.231
we just got flushed out.

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:01.817
They sent the dogs in,

00:31:01.902 --> 00:31:04.612
just like you would
if you were stalking boar

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:05.947
or shooting quail.

00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:09.450
They split us apart
and they watched.

00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:10.618
Testing us.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:19.126
How do you know this?

00:31:20.254 --> 00:31:21.796
Because

00:31:22.506 --> 00:31:24.340
that's what I would do.

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:28.386
Fantastic.

00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:30.471
Wait.

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.183
There are only
seven of us.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.353
Help me!

00:31:47.447 --> 00:31:48.990
Help!

00:32:16.059 --> 00:32:17.310
Help.

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.732
Wait.
What?

00:32:24.109 --> 00:32:25.943
It's a trap.

00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:38.164
Help me.

00:32:52.596 --> 00:32:53.888
Fuck me.

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:57.266
Help.

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:02.730
Wound one man.

00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:07.151
Make him suffer.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.404
Make him bleed.

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:15.159
Make him
call out for help,

00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:18.996
and set a trap
and kill those
who come.

00:33:23.126 --> 00:33:25.378
I know because
I have done this.

00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:30.174
So we're gonna
leave him here,
right?

00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:34.929
Come on,
look at him.
He's done.

00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:39.058
There's nothing else
we can do, right?

00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:40.643
Right?

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:49.568
We leave him.

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:52.655
I can't.

00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:55.658
Then, that's on you.

00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:15.177
Help me.

00:34:38.452 --> 00:34:41.620
Help me.

00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.799
Help me. Help me.

00:34:53.884 --> 00:34:56.260
It's a trap. It's a trap.
It's a trap.

00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:19.408
What are we gonna do?

00:35:20.702 --> 00:35:23.037
We should go to
higher ground.

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.497
Really?

00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:26.791
We're trapped on
an alien hunting planet.

00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:30.002
You really think
the solution is
to walk more?

00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:36.383
It wants us to run.

00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:40.387
That's how it hunts.

00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:46.185
This is its jungle.

00:35:47.187 --> 00:35:49.021
Its game.

00:35:50.232 --> 00:35:52.066
Its rules.

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:56.070
We run,

00:35:57.531 --> 00:35:59.031
we die.

00:36:01.076 --> 00:36:03.077
What's
the alternative?

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:06.997
We need to know
who we're dealing with.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.668
Dog tracks go that way.

00:36:13.213 --> 00:36:15.214
We go after it.

00:36:33.608 --> 00:36:34.859
Well?

00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:37.778
No movement.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.151
It looks like
we're not the only
things being hunted.

00:39:43.006 --> 00:39:44.298
Holy shit!

00:39:45.383 --> 00:39:46.675
What the fuck?

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.427
What the fuck
is that thing?

00:39:49.554 --> 00:39:52.473
This is a mistake.
We have to leave. Now.

00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:55.267
Where is
the tough guy?

00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:01.648
He left us.

00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:04.902
He's here.

00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:24.880
Run !

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.840
Run ! Run ! Run !

00:42:59.702 --> 00:43:01.828
You set us up.

00:43:03.456 --> 00:43:05.832
He led us into
that death camp,

00:43:05.917 --> 00:43:08.502
then hid and waited
for that thing to strike.

00:43:09.337 --> 00:43:11.004
We were bait.

00:43:12.507 --> 00:43:15.175
I needed to know
who we were up against.

00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:17.511
Now I do.

00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:19.846
A man is dead
because of that.

00:43:21.266 --> 00:43:23.350
This morning you were
ready to kill him.

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:26.019
It ain't this
goddamn morning, is it?

00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:27.938
At least he didn't
die in vain.

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:30.148
Why? So we could
find out firsthand

00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:32.734
what it feels like
to have our asses kicked?

00:43:32.819 --> 00:43:35.445
No. We found out
that there's more
than one of them.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.407
That they use projectile
and energy-based weapons.

00:43:38.491 --> 00:43:40.617
That they have some sort
of cloaking device.

00:43:40.702 --> 00:43:42.536
That they're bigger than us,

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.372
stronger,
but also heavier.

00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:50.377
You put us at risk
for yourself.

00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:53.046
You want to be
on your own,

00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:54.881
you got it.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.050
Why don't you tell
them the truth?

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.802
I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:43:58.886 --> 00:43:59.886
You know what
I'm talking about.

00:43:59.971 --> 00:44:01.722
The way you
looked at that thing
that was strung up,

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:04.099
the way you reacted.

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:08.812
She knows what it is.
Don't you?

00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:30.000
We don't have
a name for them.

00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:37.507
'87, Guatemala.

00:44:39.802 --> 00:44:43.013
A spec ops team
went into the jungle.

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.598
High end.

00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:47.476
Six men plus
a CIA liaison.

00:44:48.269 --> 00:44:50.228
Only one made it out.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.106
In his debrief,

00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:56.151
he said
they came in contact
with something.

00:44:56.235 --> 00:44:58.737
He gave a detailed
description.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.407
The thing
on the totem.

00:45:05.244 --> 00:45:09.373
It wore some kind of
camouflage that adjusted
to ambient light.

00:45:09.457 --> 00:45:12.334
Made it nearly invisible
in our spectrum.

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.837
It could see
in infrared.

00:45:15.922 --> 00:45:18.048
Heat signatures.

00:45:19.008 --> 00:45:21.259
He used mud
to block his.

00:45:21.344 --> 00:45:23.512
That's how
he beat it.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.226
It hunted and
killed his team,

00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:34.314
one by one.

00:45:37.026 --> 00:45:38.860
Whatever it is,

00:45:40.196 --> 00:45:42.072
wherever they're from,

00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:46.118
we're going to
kill them all.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.621
We set up
a defensive perimeter.

00:45:49.705 --> 00:45:51.998
Make it look like
we are holing up.

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:53.917
That'll bring them to us.

00:45:54.377 --> 00:45:56.503
We force them into
a choke point.

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:59.464
We get them in
overlapping fields
of fire.

00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:01.800
It can be done.

00:46:04.011 --> 00:46:06.346
I can't do it alone.

00:46:41.674 --> 00:46:44.676
You know, man,
if we ever
make it home,

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:48.180
I'm gonna do so much
fucking cocaine.

00:46:49.474 --> 00:46:51.850
I'm gonna rape
so many fine bitches.

00:46:53.436 --> 00:46:55.979
I'll be like,
"What time is it?
5:00?

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.148
"Damn.

00:46:58.232 --> 00:47:01.067
"Time to go rape me
some fine bitches."

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:02.444
You know what
I'm saying?

00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:04.821
Oh, yeah. Totally.

00:47:04.906 --> 00:47:07.574
Like, 5:00,

00:47:08.743 --> 00:47:10.494
it's bitch-raping time.

00:47:10.912 --> 00:47:11.953
Mmm.

00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:13.330
Yeah.

00:47:22.423 --> 00:47:24.966
You should
stay away from him.
Yeah.

00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:37.896
You still pissed?

00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:40.440
Fuck you.

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:56.122
You know what the difference
between you and me is?

00:47:57.667 --> 00:48:00.210
We both do
the same thing.

00:48:00.503 --> 00:48:01.878
You just do it
for a country,

00:48:01.963 --> 00:48:04.381
so you don't
have to admit
you like it.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.385
What happened to you?

00:48:08.469 --> 00:48:10.637
What made you
so fucked up?

00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:17.978
"There is no hunting
like the hunting of a man.

00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:21.398
"And those who've hunted
armed men long enough,

00:48:21.857 --> 00:48:23.984
"and like it,

00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:27.153
"never really care
for anything else
thereafter."

00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:32.158
That's pretty poetic.

00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:36.496
Did you come up with
that all by yourself?

00:48:36.581 --> 00:48:38.582
No, actually.

00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:42.168
That was Hemingway.

00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.291
Fuck.

00:49:24.378 --> 00:49:25.712
Why isn't it coming?

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:31.134
They see our traps.

00:49:48.444 --> 00:49:49.819
Hey, Doc.

00:49:49.904 --> 00:49:51.529
Hey.

00:49:51.614 --> 00:49:55.075
I think I just
figured out a way
you can be useful.

00:50:04.585 --> 00:50:06.628
Shit. Shit.

00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:10.382
I hate this.
I hate this.
I hate this.

00:50:10.466 --> 00:50:11.758
Oh !

00:50:16.806 --> 00:50:18.682
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:22.227
Oh, shit!

00:50:22.311 --> 00:50:23.436
Come on. Come on.

00:50:23.521 --> 00:50:25.271
Fucking shoot!

00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:27.941
Shoot already!

00:50:38.786 --> 00:50:40.453
Fuck

00:50:41.664 --> 00:50:43.665
all of you !

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:56.302
Is he dead? Why ain't
you smiling? Oh, shit.

00:50:57.012 --> 00:50:58.805
The thing
from the cages.

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:01.725
Maybe it thought
we're the ones
who dropped it here.

00:51:06.814 --> 00:51:08.690
Good shot, though.

00:51:11.986 --> 00:51:13.153
I missed.

00:51:21.036 --> 00:51:23.371
Over here.

00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:29.252
Over here.

00:51:37.344 --> 00:51:38.553
Over here.

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:46.561
Turn around.

00:51:57.531 --> 00:52:00.366
What the fuck are you?

00:52:11.754 --> 00:52:13.379
I'm alive.

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:22.764
You talk too loud.

00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:32.482
Smelled you
since you got here.

00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.986
If I can smell you,

00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.239
if I can hear you,

00:52:40.324 --> 00:52:41.825
they can, too.

00:52:46.914 --> 00:52:49.833
Storm coming soon.
This way.

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:52.460
Wait.

00:52:54.922 --> 00:52:56.756
Who are you?

00:52:58.926 --> 00:53:01.344
Noland,

00:53:01.428 --> 00:53:03.847
run away,

00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:06.975
live to fight
another day.

00:53:11.188 --> 00:53:13.523
I'm the one
that got away.

00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:17.777
The one you
don't fuck with.

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.659
Come on.

00:54:47.743 --> 00:54:50.244
Feel the vibe
of this place.

00:55:05.052 --> 00:55:06.302
Where are we?

00:55:06.387 --> 00:55:09.389
It's a drill
somebody left behind.

00:55:09.473 --> 00:55:14.018
The machine is dead,
but the power source ain't.

00:56:17.624 --> 00:56:19.375
Wow,
what a shithole.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.710
You live here?

00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:25.590
Oh, no. No.
This is my summer home.

00:56:25.674 --> 00:56:27.842
I winter in the Riviera.

00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:31.054
The schools are
so much nicer there.

00:56:31.138 --> 00:56:32.346
And the men. . .

00:56:32.973 --> 00:56:34.348
Ooh, la, la!

00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:38.352
By the way,
you're welcome.

00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:41.355
How have you survived?

00:56:46.153 --> 00:56:50.239
Salvaging what I can,
when I can,

00:56:50.324 --> 00:56:53.326
from whatever I can.

00:56:55.287 --> 00:56:56.412
Oh.

00:56:57.956 --> 00:57:00.416
Noland, Ronald.

00:57:00.501 --> 00:57:02.919
Air Cav.

00:57:03.003 --> 00:57:04.921
They. . .

00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.798
They drop you
all in, too?

00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:09.634
Yeah.

00:57:09.843 --> 00:57:11.886
Hmm.

00:57:12.638 --> 00:57:14.388
What a rush.

00:57:22.523 --> 00:57:24.148
Hey.

00:57:24.233 --> 00:57:25.942
Yeah, I'll tell him.

00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:30.696
Hey, Agent Orange,
you wanna put that down?

00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:31.948
Certain people
around here

00:57:32.032 --> 00:57:33.157
are particular
about other people

00:57:33.242 --> 00:57:34.367
messing with their shit.

00:57:35.869 --> 00:57:37.453
Very important, though.

00:57:37.538 --> 00:57:40.957
Disrupts the
heat signature.

00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:42.834
You motherfuckers.

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:47.380
So, you killed one?

00:57:48.215 --> 00:57:49.215
Uh-uh.

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.384
I killed two.

00:57:52.761 --> 00:57:54.220
Maybe three.

00:57:54.972 --> 00:57:57.557
I can't remember. Anyway,

00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:02.186
there's two different types
of them out there.

00:58:02.271 --> 00:58:04.856
Hmm? Now they're similar,
but they're different.

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:07.775
It's kind of like
the difference between
dogs and wolves.

00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:11.154
The ones that
are running things
up there,

00:58:11.238 --> 00:58:13.990
the larger ones,
hunt the smaller ones.

00:58:14.074 --> 00:58:16.993
It's some kind of
blood feud, I guess.

00:58:17.077 --> 00:58:19.453
Been going on
for a long time.

00:58:21.915 --> 00:58:23.499
They do this
just for sport?

00:58:23.584 --> 00:58:27.587
Oh, yeah,
they bring in fresh meat
season after season.

00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:30.173
I mean, shit you
wouldn't believe.

00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:32.842
Bring it in,

00:58:32.926 --> 00:58:37.221
and hunt it
and kill it.
In that order.

00:58:39.308 --> 00:58:41.475
How long you
been here, man?

00:58:42.853 --> 00:58:43.936
Uh. . .

00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:48.107
Seven seasons, I think.

00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:51.194
What? Ten?

00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:53.112
Damn.

00:58:53.197 --> 00:58:57.116
Anyway, every once
in a while, one of us
kills one of them.

00:58:58.035 --> 00:59:01.704
And, let me tell you,
that's when they get
real interested.

00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:05.958
See, they learn quick.
They adapt.

00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:09.921
They develop
a whole new set
of skills.

00:59:10.005 --> 00:59:14.800
They come back
the next season in threes,
always in threes.

00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:16.928
Their armor
might've changed,

00:59:17.012 --> 00:59:19.764
or their weapons
have changed,

00:59:19.848 --> 00:59:22.141
or their tactics
have changed.

00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:25.144
It's amazing.

00:59:25.729 --> 00:59:27.688
So, it's like evolution.

00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:32.568
They're trying
to make themselves
into better killers.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:34.320
Mmm-hmm.

00:59:35.322 --> 00:59:37.698
You said they come back.

00:59:39.868 --> 00:59:41.077
How?

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:43.162
They got a ship.

00:59:43.497 --> 00:59:44.664
A ship?

00:59:44.748 --> 00:59:45.748
Yeah.

00:59:45.832 --> 00:59:48.125
It's 30 yards
from their camp.

00:59:50.921 --> 00:59:52.838
I told you
they wouldn't see it.

00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:54.882
I told you
they wouldn't.

00:59:54.967 --> 00:59:56.092
You were there.

00:59:59.346 --> 01:00:01.347
You could've helped us.

01:00:04.685 --> 01:00:06.727
How do we kill them?

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.856
However you can.

01:00:12.693 --> 01:00:14.026
They must have
a weakness.

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:17.571
Not many.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:23.619
You want to survive?
You dig in deep.
You stay hid.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:26.706
Yeah, well,
we're gonna go with
door number two.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.708
How do we get out
of this valley?

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.251
Oh.

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:32.545
Ten seasons.

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:35.881
First two seasons. . .
No, three seasons
I was here,

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.634
I was walking
in the same direction,

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:42.054
trying to reach
the edge of
the preserve.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:48.269
Let me tell you something,

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:50.980
there ain't no edge
of the preserve.

01:00:53.859 --> 01:00:57.028
Maybe you and your friend
wanna tell me about that ship?

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:00.948
Let's see.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:06.370
That's a brilliant idea.
Brilliant.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.667
The whole time
I've been here,
it never occurred to me

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:13.794
to commandeer
the alien spacecraft.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:18.090
But I wouldn't know
how to fly it.

01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:21.052
He would.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.387
Of course,
you know how to fly.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.681
I'll give it a shot.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:30.811
Well. . .

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.482
I'm gonna get
some sleep.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:38.069
No noise.
They're out there.

01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:41.072
They're always
out there.

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.659
Water in there.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:50.915
Help yourself.
All of you.

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:15.773
Who's that?

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.734
My kids.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:24.698
Big one, Ilya.
And that's Sascha.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.373
Uh. . .

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:37.586
This is, uh, Candy Lee.

01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:41.215
Tits like howitzers.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:45.344
Is that your girlfriend?

01:02:47.139 --> 01:02:49.098
No. It's my sister.

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:10.327
This is old.

01:03:10.412 --> 01:03:12.538
Very old.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:15.583
They've been doing this
for a long time.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.043
You speak English.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.713
Yes.

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:23.883
Why don't you
say more?

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.390
Because I talk too much.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.458
Thanks.

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:12.473
Do you know
what I was doing
when I was taken?

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:19.021
Isaac, my spotter.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.607
He was caught.

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:23.943
I could have
done something,

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.153
but then I would have been
slaughtered along with him.

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.240
So, I hid.

01:04:30.659 --> 01:04:32.660
I watched him die.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.501
I wish I pulled
that trigger.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.087
You do what you have to,
to survive.

01:04:44.256 --> 01:04:46.632
You said we were chosen.

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:50.219
I asked, "For what?"

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.890
I should've asked why.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:58.018
It's because
we are predators.

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:01.105
Just like them.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:05.442
We're the monsters
of our own world.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.239
It's probably better
that we're never
going back.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:12.116
I am going back.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.123
I'm going
after that ship.

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:24.336
You learn how to
fly it in the last hour
and not tell me?

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.088
No.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.758
That thing strung up
at the camp might know.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:33.971
My guess is,
it'd do just about
anything to get free.

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:38.017
Enemy of my enemy.

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:40.853
That doesn't
make it a friend.

01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:48.360
So what
do I call you?

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:57.036
Smoke.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:59.121
Hey, smoke.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:01.457
Fuck.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.964
Where's Noland?

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:13.719
He's a scavenger.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.346
He wants what we have.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.900
Come on !
There must be a way out!

01:06:30.362 --> 01:06:32.112
- Damn it.
- - Do it!

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:34.073
You see the shit
you've gotten us
into, man?

01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:36.825
I told you that.
You never listen
to me, though.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.244
Six more. Six more fucking
mouths to feed.

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:41.580
I can barely stand
living with you.

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:44.208
How am I gonna
live with them, too?

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.086
Damn it!

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:48.587
What?

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.714
Say goodbye to
your little friend.

01:06:53.093 --> 01:06:55.761
You're in my house,
motherfucker!

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:00.683
Get down.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.565
Yeah, that didn't
open up shit.

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:11.819
Wasn't meant to, asshole.

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:13.946
I'm calling in
the cavalry.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:23.956
How the fuck
can we get out of here?

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.502
Open up,
you hanky fucker.

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.483
Come on !

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.115
Oh.

01:07:58.158 --> 01:08:00.617
Finally found me,
huh, big dog?

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:04.747
Well, what took
you so long?

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.753
It's not gonna open !

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:14.923
God damn it!

01:08:46.206 --> 01:08:47.664
It's toying with us.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.017
Guys?

01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.227
Oh, shit.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:47.367
Hey!

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.625
This way.

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:44.216
Hey!

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.261
I lost you guys!

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:53.767
You got to get me
out of here, man.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.269
Come on. Come on.

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:58.730
Let's move.

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:28.510
Oh. . .

01:13:18.478 --> 01:13:19.936
Oh !

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:30.590
We killed it.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:33.969
We killed it!
We fucking. . .

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:37.806
We fucking killed it.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.808
We killed it. Whoo!

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.018
We fucking killed it.
Huh?

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:46.356
Who's your daddy now,
motherfucker?

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.899
Hunt my dick, bitch !

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.334
Die, you space faggot!

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.003
Who do you think
you're dealing with, hoss?

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:09.337
Is that all you've got?

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:11.590
Go! Go!

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.853
Come on.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:27.522
Come on !

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.309
Let's get to
that ship.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:30.390
We're close. Come on.

01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:33.726
Ow! Shit!

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:36.771
Shit.

01:19:42.194 --> 01:19:43.528
Fuck!

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:52.245
Another inch,
it would've hit
my tibial artery.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.997
I guess this
is my lucky day.

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:57.208
It isn't. That trap
wasn't meant to kill.

01:19:58.169 --> 01:19:59.544
It was meant to maim.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:02.255
He's dead weight.
Come on.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:03.631
Uh, um. . .

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:07.635
No, I can still walk.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.388
Oh ! !
Shit. God.

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:12.140
No, he can't. Look.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:14.100
He's done.

01:20:14.185 --> 01:20:15.935
You're gonna beg us
to slow down.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.605
No, no, no.
To carry you.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:23.359
You can't leave me here.

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:26.196
You can't.
I have a family.

01:20:27.281 --> 01:20:29.240
I got kids.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:31.367
I'm sorry.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:35.830
We need to go.

01:20:35.915 --> 01:20:37.290
No. No!

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.417
You are taking me
with you !

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:40.793
Look, you and I
can still make it.

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:42.837
We use him.

01:20:42.922 --> 01:20:44.422
We booby-trap him.

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:46.799
No.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:49.385
They'll go to him
to take trophies.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.429
This is our last chance.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:53.556
This isn't right.
He's one of us!

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:54.641
He is.

01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:56.392
That's what
they're counting on.

01:20:56.477 --> 01:20:59.020
They want you
to feel something
for this man.

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:00.730
To be human.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:03.358
And what are you?

01:21:04.485 --> 01:21:05.652
Alive.

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:09.906
What's that worth?

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.950
You can't. Please.

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:13.785
Please,
I'm begging you.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.537
Please.

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:16.746
You should go.

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:25.964
Shit.

01:21:32.179 --> 01:21:34.180
You should've
gone with him.
I know.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:02.667
Hey.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:30.528
I want off this planet.

01:22:33.532 --> 01:22:35.199
You understand me?

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:39.871
I'll cut you down.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:42.874
You take me
to the ship.

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.209
Ship.

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:50.798
You understand me,
don't you?

01:22:54.053 --> 01:22:55.178
Huh?

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:30.380
I'm sorry.

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.090
We're not dead yet.

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:36.302
Shit.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:22.486
I guess he made it.

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:39.253
If you could
do it over again,

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:43.174
would you make
the same choice?

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:48.179
Yes.

01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:03.861
Thank you.

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.282
When the time comes,

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:11.202
I'll do us both.

01:28:12.663 --> 01:28:14.747
I promise
it'll be quick.

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:17.083
No.

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:21.837
It won't.

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:38.813
Cool.

01:28:41.108 --> 01:28:42.858
That's right.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:46.237
It's a neurotoxin.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:48.698
There's so many
to choose from
around here.

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:51.575
But don't worry.
It's not fatal.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:55.329
You'll be able to
experience everything.

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:31.907
I guess now you realize
why they chose me.

01:29:33.452 --> 01:29:36.370
I was right in front of
you guys the whole time.

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:38.706
Just watching you.

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:41.834
Earning your trust.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.466
You couldn't see me
for what I really am.

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:51.886
You see, back home,

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:53.888
I'm a murderer.

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:57.808
I'm a freak.

01:29:59.269 --> 01:30:00.478
But here,

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.481
among the monsters,

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:09.487
I'm normal.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.323
I like it here.

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:14.784
I wanna stay.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:38.557
Oh ! You came back.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:41.519
I missed my ride.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.146
Oh, thank God.

01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:45.689
Help us get out of here.

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:07.878
She's paralyzed.

01:31:09.131 --> 01:31:11.465
It gave her something.
I don't know what,

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:13.801
but it paralyzed her.

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:19.056
Come on.

01:31:37.534 --> 01:31:40.578
You're so busy
taking care of others,

01:31:40.662 --> 01:31:42.454
you forgot
to look out
for yourself.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:45.916
We're getting
out of here.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.085
You just hang
tight, okay?

01:31:48.587 --> 01:31:50.379
I didn't think
you'd come back.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:54.008
But she,

01:31:54.092 --> 01:31:56.385
she never lost
faith in you.

01:31:57.304 --> 01:31:59.138
I guess I owe you
an apology.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.767
You are a good man
after all.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:06.604
No.

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:08.647
I'm not.

01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:14.820
But I'm fast.

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.712
Come here.

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:40.179
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:42.056
I won't.

01:33:57.173 --> 01:33:58.674
Help me.

01:34:00.719 --> 01:34:02.011
I'm one of you.

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:35.502
Yes.

01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:37.921
Come on. Come on.

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:41.633
Come on.
Come on. Do it.

01:34:42.385 --> 01:34:43.844
I'm here. Kill me.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:47.681
Come on.

01:34:47.766 --> 01:34:49.266
Do it now. Kill me!

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:01.547
Oh, shit.

01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:56.930
Did you get it?

01:38:57.724 --> 01:38:59.057
Yeah.

01:39:12.155 --> 01:39:13.822
I'm Royce.

01:39:16.826 --> 01:39:19.036
Nice to meet you, Royce.

01:39:21.372 --> 01:39:23.040
I'm Isabelle.

01:40:49.794 --> 01:40:51.128
Now,

01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:55.340
let's find a way off
this fucking planet.

01:41:18.823 --> 01:41:20.407
Don't tell Aunt Mary
about Uncle John

01:41:20.491 --> 01:41:22.784
He claims he has the music
But he has a lot of fun

01:41:22.869 --> 01:41:26.747
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:41:26.831 --> 01:41:32.544
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

01:41:32.628 --> 01:41:35.255
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:37.924
She's got everything
that Uncle John needs

01:41:38.009 --> 01:41:41.928
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:41:42.013 --> 01:41:47.768
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:50.771
Well, I saw Uncle John
with bald-head Sally

01:41:50.855 --> 01:41:53.148
He saw Aunt Mary coming and
he ducked back in the alley

01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:57.152
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:41:57.236 --> 01:42:02.616
Oh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:03.825
Ahhh!

01:42:17.298 --> 01:42:20.091
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet

01:42:20.176 --> 01:42:22.969
She's got everything
that Uncle John needs

01:42:23.054 --> 01:42:26.973
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:31.770
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight

01:42:31.854 --> 01:42:35.440
Have some fun
Having me some fun tonight
