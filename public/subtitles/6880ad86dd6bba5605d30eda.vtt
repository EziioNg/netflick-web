00:39.799 --> 00:42.039
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

00:42.176 --> 00:45.136
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life,

00:45.936 --> 00:48.436
I started having these dreams of flying.

00:49.806 --> 00:51.266
I was free.

00:54.486 --> 00:58.066
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

01:07.826 --> 01:10.786
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

01:10.836 --> 01:13.626
but not on vet benefits, not in this economy.

01:15.126 --> 01:17.836
A VA check and 12 bucks will get you a cup of coffee.

01:18.506 --> 01:20.676
I'm what they call... waitlisted.

01:29.726 --> 01:34.226
The Bengal Tiger, extinct for over a century is making a comeback.

01:34.316 --> 01:38.566
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are the latest of a number of species

01:38.656 --> 01:42.486
that have been cloned back into existence in the past five years.

01:42.526 --> 01:47.786
I became a marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life.

01:49.116 --> 01:52.496
I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass.

01:55.376 --> 02:00.836
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

02:04.346 --> 02:06.676
Let's get it straight, upfront.

02:06.716 --> 02:08.176
I don't want your pity.

02:09.726 --> 02:12.436
You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet.

02:17.356 --> 02:18.856
The strong prey on the weak.

02:19.896 --> 02:21.276
That's just the way things are.

02:23.026 --> 02:24.656
And nobody does a damn thing.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.176
Get off! Get off of him!

02:44.846 --> 02:49.426
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.

03:04.446 --> 03:06.616
I hope you realized you just lost yourself a customer.

03:08.196 --> 03:10.366
Candy-ass bitch.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.746
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.806
- It doesn't look like him. - It's him.

03:30.886 --> 03:33.136
You Jake Sully?

03:33.226 --> 03:35.476
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

03:36.396 --> 03:37.516
It's about your brother.

03:44.776 --> 03:46.776
We're looking for Sully, T.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.786
In there.

04:14.016 --> 04:15.476
Jesus, Tommy.

04:15.846 --> 04:17.686
The strong prey on the weak.

04:18.556 --> 04:20.936
A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be

04:21.816 --> 04:23.606
for the paper in his wallet.

04:25.446 --> 04:27.776
The concern of the suits was touching.

04:27.866 --> 04:31.366
Your brother represented a significant investment.

04:31.446 --> 04:33.906
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.

04:33.996 --> 04:38.456
And since your genome is identical to his, you could step into his shoes,

04:39.666 --> 04:41.036
so to speak.

04:41.876 --> 04:44.756
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

04:45.046 --> 04:48.716
You could do something important. You can make a difference.

04:53.976 --> 04:55.886
And the pay is good.

04:56.516 --> 04:57.516
Very good.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.646
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

05:01.266 --> 05:03.726
He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space

05:03.776 --> 05:05.106
to find the answers.

05:10.066 --> 05:13.906
Me, I was just another dumb grunt getting sent someplace he was gonna regret.

05:46.396 --> 05:47.856
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

05:48.986 --> 05:51.066
It doesn't feel like six years.

05:51.116 --> 05:54.446
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.

06:07.416 --> 06:09.126
Are we there yet?

06:09.376 --> 06:11.466
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

06:11.796 --> 06:13.386
We're there.

06:13.886 --> 06:17.636
You've been in cryo for five years, nine months and 22 days.

06:17.676 --> 06:20.516
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

06:20.596 --> 06:25.686
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience.

06:26.026 --> 06:28.986
The staff thanks you in advance.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.666
Up ahead was Pandora.

06:46.046 --> 06:50.006
You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there.

07:08.936 --> 07:11.776
Valkyrie 1-6, copy...

07:11.986 --> 07:15.616
Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

07:15.906 --> 07:20.196
Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

07:39.266 --> 07:42.676
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on! - Exo-packs on! Let's go!

07:42.726 --> 07:44.096
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

07:44.186 --> 07:47.896
you're unconscious in 20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!

07:47.936 --> 07:51.276
Let's nobody be dead today! Looks very bad on my report.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.736
Hell's Gate tower, this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

07:55.816 --> 07:57.616
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

08:40.076 --> 08:42.406
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

08:42.446 --> 08:45.956
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go! - Harnesses off! One minute!

08:45.996 --> 08:49.996
When that ramp comes down, go directly into the base. Do not stop!

08:50.086 --> 08:52.626
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

08:59.136 --> 09:03.006
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there! Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

09:13.146 --> 09:15.186
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

09:16.236 --> 09:19.276
You may be out, but you never lose the attitude.

09:29.956 --> 09:32.836
Let's go, special case! Do not make me wait for you!

09:32.916 --> 09:34.666
Well, well, ladies.

09:36.086 --> 09:37.836
Look at all this fresh meat!

09:43.716 --> 09:47.846
Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

09:47.936 --> 09:49.476
fighting for freedom.

09:56.186 --> 09:57.686
Look out, hot rod!

09:59.106 --> 10:01.026
But out here they're just hired guns,

10:01.116 --> 10:03.986
taking the money, working for the company.

10:04.036 --> 10:05.446
Check this out, man.

10:06.036 --> 10:07.536
Meals on wheels.

10:08.866 --> 10:11.746
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

10:12.416 --> 10:13.706
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

10:13.746 --> 10:15.336
Got it! Need them!

10:24.596 --> 10:26.886
You're not in Kansas anymore.

10:29.306 --> 10:33.226
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

10:33.306 --> 10:37.066
Respect that fact every second of every day.

10:39.316 --> 10:40.946
If there is a hell,

10:41.696 --> 10:46.326
you might want to go there for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

10:47.156 --> 10:49.326
Out there, beyond that fence,

10:49.406 --> 10:53.746
every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

10:53.826 --> 10:56.996
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

10:58.876 --> 11:03.716
We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi.

11:03.716 --> 11:06.096
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

11:06.176 --> 11:09.016
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

11:09.016 --> 11:13.396
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

11:14.016 --> 11:15.856
They are very hard to kill.

11:17.316 --> 11:21.316
As head of security, it is my job to keep you alive.

11:23.236 --> 11:25.026
I will not succeed.

11:27.196 --> 11:28.616
Not with all of you.

11:29.696 --> 11:31.746
If you wish to survive,

11:31.826 --> 11:34.706
you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.

11:35.496 --> 11:37.706
You've got to obey the rules.

11:38.496 --> 11:40.506
Pandora rules.

11:41.756 --> 11:43.466
Rule number one...

11:43.546 --> 11:47.006
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief to put your mind at ease.

11:49.346 --> 11:54.886
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake! You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

11:55.556 --> 11:57.806
Wow! You look just like him.

11:57.896 --> 12:01.646
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman. I went through avatar training with him.

12:01.736 --> 12:03.736
...into the bio-lab.

12:04.446 --> 12:08.986
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here. Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.326
- Hi. - Hey.

12:10.406 --> 12:11.996
Link... Here's the link room right here.

12:12.076 --> 12:14.366
This is where we're connecting to the avatar.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.286
Me and Norm are here to drive

12:18.286 --> 12:21.496
these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.

12:21.586 --> 12:26.586
And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives.

12:26.676 --> 12:28.636
- Hey. Welcome. - Hey.

12:28.716 --> 12:31.096
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you. - Thanks.

12:33.096 --> 12:34.976
Damn! They got big.

12:35.056 --> 12:37.596
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

12:37.686 --> 12:40.016
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.

12:40.106 --> 12:41.976
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

12:42.066 --> 12:43.986
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted,

12:43.986 --> 12:45.946
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

12:46.446 --> 12:47.816
There's yours.

12:49.486 --> 12:51.156
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

12:51.156 --> 12:54.076
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you. - Good to meet you, yeah.

13:17.976 --> 13:19.476
Looks like him.

13:20.726 --> 13:22.566
No, it looks like you.

13:23.646 --> 13:25.606
This is your avatar now, Jake.

13:28.856 --> 13:33.236
And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar,

13:34.326 --> 13:36.116
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

13:37.496 --> 13:38.956
or something.

13:40.286 --> 13:44.706
Which is why they offered me the gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

13:45.756 --> 13:47.626
which is insanely expensive.

13:48.376 --> 13:51.836
Is this right? I just say whatever to the video log?

13:51.926 --> 13:54.096
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.

13:54.176 --> 13:56.216
You know, what we see, what we feel.

13:56.306 --> 13:59.016
- It's all part of the science. - And good science is good observation.

13:59.096 --> 14:01.556
Plus it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.

14:01.556 --> 14:04.396
All right. Whatever.

14:06.356 --> 14:08.026
So...

14:09.066 --> 14:10.526
Well, here I am,

14:12.196 --> 14:13.696
doing science.

14:14.866 --> 14:16.446
They're coming out!

14:16.536 --> 14:19.036
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

14:26.206 --> 14:27.706
Oh, God.

14:29.586 --> 14:31.376
Where's the lab coat? Where's the lab coat?

14:31.386 --> 14:37.766
Who's got my goddamn cigarette? Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

14:38.886 --> 14:42.306
- Thank you! - Grace Augustine is a legend.

14:42.396 --> 14:44.896
She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book,

14:44.976 --> 14:47.776
I mean, literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.

14:47.776 --> 14:50.066
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.

14:50.606 --> 14:52.446
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

14:52.566 --> 14:56.236
Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

14:57.996 --> 15:01.706
Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?

15:02.746 --> 15:04.996
May the All Mother...

15:04.996 --> 15:07.206
...smile upon our first meeting.

15:07.206 --> 15:10.416
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

15:11.586 --> 15:13.886
I studied for five years...

15:13.886 --> 15:15.966
...but there is much to learn.

15:16.176 --> 15:19.676
- Grace? This is Jake Sully. - Ma'am.

15:20.226 --> 15:24.266
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are, and I don't need you. I need your brother.

15:24.356 --> 15:27.976
You know, the PhD who trained for three years for this mission?

15:28.066 --> 15:29.476
He's dead.

15:30.186 --> 15:32.526
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.

15:33.606 --> 15:36.946
- How much lab training have you had? - I dissected a frog once.

15:38.326 --> 15:41.536
You see? You see? I mean, they're just pissing on us

15:41.616 --> 15:43.996
without even the courtesy of calling it rain.

15:43.996 --> 15:45.326
- I'm going to Selfridge. - No, Grace,

15:45.326 --> 15:47.956
- I don't think that's a good idea. - No, man, this is such bullshit!

15:48.046 --> 15:49.456
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

15:49.546 --> 15:52.416
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.

15:53.466 --> 15:57.256
Here tomorrow, 0800. Try and use big words.

16:05.556 --> 16:09.516
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower. You are cleared for south departure.

16:09.526 --> 16:12.396
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

16:18.276 --> 16:19.486
- You see that? - Yes, sir.

16:19.576 --> 16:21.656
No, you didn't. You were looking at the monitor.

16:21.746 --> 16:24.656
I love this putter, Ronnie! I love this putter.

16:27.536 --> 16:31.836
Parker, you know, I used to think it was benign neglect,

16:31.836 --> 16:34.876
but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.

16:34.876 --> 16:38.466
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

16:42.846 --> 16:46.346
I need a researcher. Not some jarhead dropout.

16:46.346 --> 16:48.016
Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him.

16:48.106 --> 16:49.686
- Lucky? - Yeah.

16:49.686 --> 16:51.726
How is this in any way lucky?

16:51.816 --> 16:53.566
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

16:53.646 --> 16:56.566
and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

16:56.906 --> 16:58.566
A Marine we can use.

16:58.656 --> 17:00.576
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.

17:00.576 --> 17:04.036
The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there!

17:04.116 --> 17:06.076
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts

17:06.076 --> 17:07.206
and the minds of the natives.

17:07.206 --> 17:09.076
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?

17:09.166 --> 17:10.706
If you look like them and you talk like them,

17:10.706 --> 17:12.416
then they'll start trusting us.

17:12.496 --> 17:14.546
We build them a school, we teach them English,

17:14.546 --> 17:16.586
but after, what, how many years?

17:16.676 --> 17:18.256
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.

17:18.256 --> 17:21.596
Yeah, that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.

17:21.596 --> 17:23.716
Right. Come here.

17:24.806 --> 17:26.556
I can't... I can't...

17:29.806 --> 17:32.766
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

17:32.856 --> 17:35.936
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

17:36.026 --> 17:39.236
That's the only reason. It's what pays for the whole party.

17:39.316 --> 17:41.236
It's what pays for your science.

17:42.616 --> 17:45.786
Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation,

17:45.786 --> 17:47.116
we're on the brink of war,

17:47.116 --> 17:50.416
and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

17:50.416 --> 17:53.956
So use what you've got, and get me some results.

18:04.846 --> 18:07.426
So, how much link time have you logged?

18:07.426 --> 18:11.146
- About 520 hours. - That's good.

18:11.146 --> 18:15.526
You're in there. You're here. How much have you logged?

18:15.606 --> 18:18.276
Zip. But I read a manual.

18:19.236 --> 18:21.276
Tell me you're joking.

18:22.616 --> 18:23.986
This is cool.

18:24.446 --> 18:25.866
Let's go.

18:29.786 --> 18:31.496
Don't. I got this.

18:35.876 --> 18:38.506
So you just figured you'd come out here,

18:38.506 --> 18:41.126
to the most hostile environment known to man,

18:41.216 --> 18:44.966
with no training of any kind, and see how it went?

18:45.056 --> 18:47.386
What was going through your head?

18:47.466 --> 18:50.306
Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.686
- Biometrics are good. - Link three is ready.

18:54.146 --> 18:58.436
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

18:59.566 --> 19:03.316
Down. Just relax and let your mind go blank.

19:04.026 --> 19:05.986
That shouldn't be hard for you.

19:05.986 --> 19:07.826
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

19:07.906 --> 19:09.366
Initiate link.

19:10.156 --> 19:12.706
Run sequence unit three. Go.

19:12.706 --> 19:14.166
Launching.

19:19.586 --> 19:21.086
I have the first congruency.

19:29.516 --> 19:35.056
- That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity. - Go figure.

19:35.056 --> 19:37.056
Phase-Iock 40%.

19:41.026 --> 19:42.606
All right. Going in.

19:43.236 --> 19:44.816
I'm going in in four.

19:47.866 --> 19:50.486
Phase-Iock 99%. Link is stable.

20:05.336 --> 20:11.266
He's in. Jake, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Jake?

20:11.266 --> 20:12.886
Pupillary reflex is good.

20:15.646 --> 20:18.686
Pinna response normal. How you feeling, Jake?

20:19.396 --> 20:20.776
Hey, guys.

20:21.646 --> 20:23.436
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

20:23.446 --> 20:24.896
Good!

20:24.906 --> 20:26.406
Yeah, we're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.616
- And touch your thumb to your fingers. - Yeah.

20:28.696 --> 20:30.076
- Thumb to your fingers. - No problem.

20:30.156 --> 20:31.736
That's good. I can see you can remember that one.

20:31.826 --> 20:33.996
- Got it. - Well, if you want to sit up,

20:34.076 --> 20:35.406
- that's fine. - Okay, good. Just take it

20:35.416 --> 20:38.416
nice and slow, Jake. Good. Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

20:38.496 --> 20:41.996
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all? You're wiggling your toes!

20:42.086 --> 20:43.836
- Good. Good, Jake. - That's great.

20:45.376 --> 20:48.426
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

20:48.506 --> 20:51.176
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

20:52.516 --> 20:53.806
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.136
Take it easy. Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

20:56.226 --> 20:58.806
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run,

20:58.806 --> 21:00.976
- so take it easy. - Wait.

21:00.976 --> 21:02.476
- Jake. - Sit down, Jake.

21:02.566 --> 21:04.936
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

21:05.606 --> 21:07.276
- I need you to sit down. Jake! - It's okay.

21:07.356 --> 21:09.156
- Buddy, listen to me. - It's all good. I got this.

21:09.236 --> 21:12.946
- Jake, you need to sit down right now. - Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

21:12.946 --> 21:15.156
Listen to me. For your own safety, you need to sit down.

21:15.156 --> 21:17.996
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

21:18.076 --> 21:20.326
- God, Jake, watch your tail. - Yeah!

21:20.416 --> 21:24.506
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

21:24.586 --> 21:26.876
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

21:26.966 --> 21:27.966
By the numbers.

21:28.046 --> 21:29.466
- Jake. Come on. - Jake! Listen to me.

21:29.546 --> 21:31.136
You're not used to your avatar body.

21:31.216 --> 21:32.966
- This is dangerous. - This is great.

21:32.966 --> 21:36.266
- Jake? Jake, listen to me. - Come on. They're gonna put you out.

21:38.806 --> 21:41.476
- Norm, sit down. - No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

21:41.566 --> 21:43.146
God damn it! Bring them home!

21:43.226 --> 21:45.896
- Norm! Do not leave control! - You're not ready for it!

21:47.646 --> 21:51.486
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills. - So close!

21:51.576 --> 21:53.156
I don't even have to play defense on it.

21:53.236 --> 21:54.736
Hey, guys. Hey.

21:54.826 --> 21:57.156
- It's okay, I'll get him. - Jake, you have to come back!

21:57.156 --> 21:58.996
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

22:01.536 --> 22:03.166
- Watch it! - Sorry!

22:03.246 --> 22:04.666
Come on!

22:05.796 --> 22:08.666
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

22:18.186 --> 22:20.596
- Jeez! Sorry. - Watch it!

22:42.876 --> 22:44.376
Hey, Marine!

22:45.206 --> 22:46.626
Damn.

22:48.666 --> 22:51.836
- Grace? - Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

22:53.046 --> 22:54.596
Think fast.

22:55.386 --> 22:57.596
Motor control's looking good.

23:07.476 --> 23:11.816
Come on, everybody, quiet down! All right, gang, lights out.

23:12.486 --> 23:14.066
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

23:14.066 --> 23:15.566
Hey, hey, hey!

23:16.076 --> 23:18.286
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

23:18.366 --> 23:19.906
That's kind of freaky.

23:19.906 --> 23:22.406
Come on. Scat.

23:23.326 --> 23:24.746
Good night.

23:26.456 --> 23:29.586
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

23:53.606 --> 23:54.656
Welcome back.

24:02.616 --> 24:04.956
- You okay? You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay.

24:06.666 --> 24:11.956
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties. And this here is my baby.

24:12.546 --> 24:14.176
Hold on a second.

24:14.716 --> 24:17.636
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

24:18.046 --> 24:22.176
- We bounce at zero-nine. - Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

24:22.886 --> 24:24.846
Vine strike's still loose.

24:24.936 --> 24:27.186
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

24:27.186 --> 24:28.556
Watch it!

24:29.186 --> 24:31.856
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the only thing flying around out there.

24:31.936 --> 24:33.686
Or the biggest.

24:33.696 --> 24:36.526
I'm gonna need you on a door gun. I'm a man short.

24:36.616 --> 24:38.446
I thought you'd never ask.

24:39.776 --> 24:42.946
There's your man. See you on the flight line.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.046
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

24:56.126 --> 24:58.756
This low gravity'll make you soft.

25:00.176 --> 25:01.716
You get soft,

25:04.976 --> 25:08.266
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.

25:09.356 --> 25:11.896
I pulled your record, Corporal.

25:11.976 --> 25:14.396
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

25:16.356 --> 25:18.696
Nothing like this here, though.

25:20.946 --> 25:24.366
You got some heart, kid, showing up in this neighborhood.

25:24.366 --> 25:26.286
I figured it's just another hellhole.

25:26.366 --> 25:28.786
I was First Recon myself.

25:28.876 --> 25:32.086
A few years ahead of you. Well, maybe more than a few.

25:33.046 --> 25:35.966
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

25:36.046 --> 25:37.506
I come out here?

25:38.296 --> 25:41.546
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

25:41.636 --> 25:46.226
Yeah. They could fix me up, if I rotated back.

25:46.886 --> 25:51.976
Yeah, and make me pretty again. But you know what? I kind of like it.

25:52.066 --> 25:54.896
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.

25:56.896 --> 26:02.826
The Avatar Program is a bad joke. Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

26:02.906 --> 26:09.916
However, it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.

26:09.916 --> 26:11.576
- Clear! - Clear!

26:16.756 --> 26:21.966
A recon gyrene in an avatar body. That's a potent mix.

26:21.966 --> 26:23.636
Give me the goose bumps.

26:23.716 --> 26:27.136
Such a Marine could provide the intel I need,

26:27.226 --> 26:28.926
right on the ground.

26:30.226 --> 26:32.146
Right in the hostiles' camp.

26:32.936 --> 26:38.276
Look, Sully. I want you to learn these savages from the inside.

26:38.356 --> 26:40.106
I want you to gain their trust.

26:40.106 --> 26:41.946
I need to know how to force their cooperation

26:41.946 --> 26:44.486
or hammer them hard if they won't.

26:45.946 --> 26:48.286
- Am I still with Augustine? - On paper.

26:48.286 --> 26:52.456
Yeah, you walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one,

26:53.956 --> 26:55.536
but you report to me.

26:56.956 --> 26:58.756
Can you do that for me, son?

27:00.296 --> 27:01.676
Hell, yeah, sir.

27:02.586 --> 27:04.386
Well, all right, then.

27:15.396 --> 27:18.356
Son, I take care of my own.

27:18.356 --> 27:19.486
You get me what I need,

27:19.566 --> 27:22.816
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.

27:23.696 --> 27:25.196
Your real legs.

27:27.866 --> 27:29.996
That sounds real good, sir.

27:36.626 --> 27:39.336
- Link's ready! - Phase-Iock 40%.

27:39.956 --> 27:43.046
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.

27:43.126 --> 27:46.676
I have five congruencies. Phase-Iock 90%.

27:46.756 --> 27:48.096
Link three ready.

27:48.766 --> 27:50.426
All right, I'm going in.

28:22.336 --> 28:24.586
Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right.

28:25.136 --> 28:26.466
Got it! Thanks.

28:27.466 --> 28:31.056
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows and some juveniles.

29:19.146 --> 29:21.516
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

29:24.986 --> 29:28.776
- Norm! Your pack. - Pack.

29:31.406 --> 29:35.406
Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun is enough.

29:37.826 --> 29:39.496
You the man, Doc.

30:16.076 --> 30:19.206
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

30:22.086 --> 30:25.246
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

30:30.796 --> 30:33.426
So, how will they know we're here?

30:33.466 --> 30:36.176
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

30:40.266 --> 30:42.266
This was our school.

30:42.306 --> 30:45.606
Now it's just... storage.

30:46.436 --> 30:48.356
The kids were so bright.

30:49.066 --> 30:50.276
Eager to learn.

30:50.446 --> 30:52.856
They picked up English faster than I could teach it.

30:54.326 --> 30:57.286
So, we'll take a couple of these Ph monitors...

30:57.576 --> 30:59.496
...and a soil probe.

31:00.156 --> 31:05.036
That little yellow case back there. The old microscope.

31:06.086 --> 31:07.166
Here.

31:07.256 --> 31:08.836
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

31:09.376 --> 31:11.046
The stingbats knocked them down.

31:19.136 --> 31:22.346
I keep hoping someone will come back in and read them.

31:22.436 --> 31:24.146
Why don't they come back?

31:26.066 --> 31:32.236
The Omaticaya... learned as much about us as they needed to.

31:37.326 --> 31:38.576
What happened here?

31:42.536 --> 31:45.536
Are you going to help us with this gear? We've got a lot to do.

32:00.136 --> 32:02.096
- Keep moving, Norm. - Keep up, guys!

32:04.516 --> 32:08.106
- And here I go. - Scanning.

32:10.526 --> 32:13.696
Wow! It's that fast?

32:15.946 --> 32:18.026
- Amazing, isn't it? - Yeah.

32:18.116 --> 32:21.906
So, that is signal transduction from this root

32:21.996 --> 32:25.616
to the root of the tree next to it. So, we should take a sample.

32:25.706 --> 32:27.376
Okay. Sample.

32:29.416 --> 32:33.716
You know, it's probably electrical, based on the speed of the reaction.

32:34.376 --> 32:38.346
Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.

32:38.806 --> 32:40.596
Right.

33:08.376 --> 33:10.246
So, here I go.

33:35.736 --> 33:39.566
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

33:43.326 --> 33:44.906
It's already pissed off.

33:45.116 --> 33:48.036
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

33:53.876 --> 33:57.966
It's a territorial threat display. Do not run, or he'll charge.

33:58.586 --> 34:00.386
So, what do I do, dance with it?

34:00.846 --> 34:03.926
Just hold your ground.

34:19.026 --> 34:21.406
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

34:22.526 --> 34:24.486
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.906
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

34:29.456 --> 34:32.036
That's right, get your punk ass back to mommy.

34:32.126 --> 34:35.046
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing. You keep running.

34:35.126 --> 34:38.126
Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?

34:41.216 --> 34:42.336
Oh, shit.

34:54.146 --> 34:56.646
So what about this one? Run? Don't run? What?

34:58.066 --> 35:00.106
Run! Definitely run!

38:46.586 --> 38:47.876
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

38:47.966 --> 38:50.876
We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders.

38:52.596 --> 38:55.926
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.

38:55.926 --> 38:57.556
He won't make it till morning.

40:50.456 --> 40:52.416
I don't have all goddamn night.

40:53.256 --> 40:55.336
Come on! Come on!

42:09.286 --> 42:10.916
Hey, wait. Don't!

42:14.416 --> 42:15.546
Great.

43:13.016 --> 43:16.566
Look, I know you probably don't understand this,

43:22.656 --> 43:23.906
but thank you.

43:29.036 --> 43:30.496
Thank you.

43:34.456 --> 43:35.956
That was pretty impressive.

43:38.666 --> 43:41.626
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. It was...

43:45.176 --> 43:48.306
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

43:49.306 --> 43:50.766
Wait up!

43:51.516 --> 43:53.346
Just... Hey, slow down.

43:53.346 --> 43:56.436
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.

43:57.516 --> 44:00.566
- Damn! - Don't thank.

44:01.486 --> 44:03.856
You don't thank for this.

44:05.406 --> 44:09.366
This is sad. Very sad only.

44:10.286 --> 44:12.366
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

44:13.206 --> 44:15.036
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

44:18.546 --> 44:21.706
All this is your fault. They did not need to die.

44:22.546 --> 44:24.626
My fault? They attacked me. How am I the bad guy?

44:24.716 --> 44:26.386
Your fault!

44:26.846 --> 44:29.556
- Your fault! - Easy. Easy.

44:29.636 --> 44:33.386
You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do.

44:33.386 --> 44:34.886
Easy.

44:37.146 --> 44:39.566
Fine. Fine.

44:40.726 --> 44:42.856
If you love your little forest friends,

44:44.396 --> 44:46.236
why not let them just kill my ass?

44:47.236 --> 44:49.026
What's the thinking?

44:49.826 --> 44:52.536
- Why save you? - Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

44:56.956 --> 44:58.916
You have a strong heart.

45:01.046 --> 45:02.256
No fear.

45:06.756 --> 45:09.636
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

45:16.056 --> 45:18.476
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

45:19.146 --> 45:21.356
Look, maybe you should teach me.

45:21.436 --> 45:23.646
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

45:23.736 --> 45:25.646
Well, then teach me how to See.

45:25.646 --> 45:28.196
- No one can teach you to See. - Whoa.

45:29.486 --> 45:31.946
Look, come on, can't we talk?

45:32.906 --> 45:36.786
Say, where'd you learn to speak English? Dr. Augustine's school?

45:41.626 --> 45:42.456
You're like a baby.

45:49.506 --> 45:51.136
I need your help.

45:52.176 --> 45:54.096
You should not be here.

45:55.016 --> 45:57.846
- Okay, take me with you. - No! Go back.

46:00.516 --> 46:01.556
No.

46:03.066 --> 46:04.316
Go back.

46:25.916 --> 46:26.956
No!

46:48.736 --> 46:49.946
What...

46:53.696 --> 46:55.196
What are they?

46:56.536 --> 46:58.536
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

46:59.576 --> 47:01.246
Very pure spirits.

47:25.356 --> 47:27.316
What was that all about?

47:29.396 --> 47:30.526
Come.

47:31.946 --> 47:33.066
Come!

47:35.236 --> 47:36.576
Where are we going?

47:47.086 --> 47:48.166
Come.

48:03.306 --> 48:05.056
What's your name?

48:05.146 --> 48:06.226
Shit!

48:31.716 --> 48:32.836
Okay.

48:35.546 --> 48:38.426
Calm people, calm.

48:44.186 --> 48:47.016
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

48:49.476 --> 48:52.396
These demons are forbidden here.

48:53.196 --> 48:55.526
There has been a sign.

48:55.526 --> 48:57.866
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

49:02.696 --> 49:03.696
Bring him.

49:05.206 --> 49:06.786
What's going on?

49:09.126 --> 49:10.246
Wait.

49:13.216 --> 49:14.836
What's happening?

49:15.716 --> 49:16.716
Hey!

50:26.906 --> 50:28.246
Father...

50:29.076 --> 50:30.876
...I see you.

50:42.596 --> 50:44.006
This creature...

50:44.306 --> 50:47.386
...why do you bring him here?

50:48.846 --> 50:50.226
I was going to kill him...

50:50.516 --> 50:52.346
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

50:52.516 --> 50:54.606
I have said...

50:54.606 --> 50:57.276
...no dreamwalker will come here.

50:57.356 --> 50:58.686
What's he saying?

50:58.696 --> 51:01.526
His alien smell fills my nose.

51:01.616 --> 51:02.696
Hey, what's he saying?

51:02.696 --> 51:04.946
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

51:06.576 --> 51:09.536
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

51:13.206 --> 51:14.706
Step back!

51:16.836 --> 51:20.256
I will look at this alien.

51:20.376 --> 51:21.676
That is Mother.

51:21.676 --> 51:25.676
She is Tsahik. The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

51:26.516 --> 51:27.886
Who's Eywa?

51:34.726 --> 51:36.476
What are you called?

51:37.396 --> 51:38.776
Jake Sully.

51:48.696 --> 51:51.496
- Why did you come to us? - I came to learn.

51:52.866 --> 51:55.826
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

51:55.916 --> 51:59.256
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

52:00.756 --> 52:03.086
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

52:04.296 --> 52:06.966
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

52:07.056 --> 52:08.506
What are you?

52:10.766 --> 52:13.976
I was a Marine. A...

52:14.846 --> 52:17.476
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

52:17.936 --> 52:20.636
A warrior! I could kill him easily!

52:20.856 --> 52:22.146
No!

52:22.566 --> 52:26.776
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

52:26.776 --> 52:28.736
...we have seen.

52:28.736 --> 52:31.616
We need to learn more about him.

52:34.036 --> 52:35.996
My Daughter...

52:35.996 --> 52:40.376
...you will teach him our way...

52:40.376 --> 52:43.836
...to speak and walk as we do.

52:43.836 --> 52:47.466
Why me? That's not fair...

52:48.256 --> 52:52.386
It is decided. My daughter will teach you our ways.

52:52.476 --> 52:56.056
Learn well, Jakesully.

52:56.856 --> 53:00.646
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

53:19.376 --> 53:20.836
Good evening.

53:23.876 --> 53:25.666
Please don't get up.

53:27.506 --> 53:28.836
Excuse me.

53:31.176 --> 53:32.346
Sorry.

53:35.436 --> 53:37.136
Hey, how you doing?

53:45.736 --> 53:46.736
Thank you.

53:49.276 --> 53:51.616
You know, I don't even know your name.

53:52.326 --> 53:54.746
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

53:57.036 --> 53:58.956
Again, a whole lot slower?

53:58.996 --> 54:00.286
Neytiri.

54:00.376 --> 54:01.996
Neytili.

54:02.496 --> 54:04.296
Neytiri.

54:04.756 --> 54:06.666
Neytiri.

54:07.676 --> 54:09.676
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

54:10.296 --> 54:11.546
It's nice.

54:54.386 --> 54:56.676
- Jake. Jake! - He's in alpha.

54:56.766 --> 54:59.806
- He's coming out right now. - Jake. Jake!

55:01.596 --> 55:04.686
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

55:06.356 --> 55:09.026
There you go. There you go, there you go.

55:09.106 --> 55:11.486
You're okay. You're okay.

55:11.566 --> 55:14.486
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

55:17.576 --> 55:20.116
- Is the avatar safe? - Yeah, Doc.

55:21.246 --> 55:23.956
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

55:24.956 --> 55:27.956
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

55:28.046 --> 55:32.176
disappearing into the brush with this angry thanator coming after him.

55:32.176 --> 55:35.176
- Hey, it's not something you can teach. - That is awesome.

55:35.256 --> 55:37.636
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

55:37.636 --> 55:40.976
the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all.

55:42.306 --> 55:43.806
"Jarhead clan"?

55:45.396 --> 55:48.436
- And it worked? - Hey, I'm practically family.

55:49.526 --> 55:53.026
They're gonna study me. I have to learn to be one of them.

55:53.026 --> 55:54.696
That's called taking the initiative, son.

55:54.696 --> 55:57.236
- I wish I had 10 more like you. - Look, Sully. Sully.

55:57.326 --> 56:00.746
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

56:01.496 --> 56:07.336
You know, I mean, we try to give them medicine, education, roads.

56:07.336 --> 56:09.166
But no, no, no, they like mud.

56:09.256 --> 56:13.216
And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that they're...

56:13.796 --> 56:16.846
Hey, can you... Can somebody just... Sector 12.

56:18.636 --> 56:21.846
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

56:21.846 --> 56:24.056
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

56:24.056 --> 56:30.226
Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit

56:30.236 --> 56:35.606
within 200 klicks in any direction. I mean, look at all that cheddar!

56:39.366 --> 56:41.866
- Well, who gets them to move? - Guess.

56:43.786 --> 56:47.326
- What if they won't go? - I'm betting that they will.

56:47.836 --> 56:50.546
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

56:51.376 --> 56:54.216
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

56:54.296 --> 56:58.046
but there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press,

56:58.136 --> 57:01.386
and that's a bad quarterly statement. I didn't make up the rules.

57:01.386 --> 57:04.596
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move,

57:05.346 --> 57:08.436
otherwise it's gonna have to be all stick. Okay?

57:09.016 --> 57:12.726
You got three months. That's when the 'dozers get there.

57:12.816 --> 57:14.816
Well, we're wasting time.

57:15.776 --> 57:16.906
I like this guy.

57:17.066 --> 57:20.576
- Guys, right now... - Okay, let's run through them again.

57:20.576 --> 57:22.906
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

57:24.956 --> 57:27.916
- Eytucan. - Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

57:27.996 --> 57:31.166
But she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.

57:31.246 --> 57:32.836
Got it.

57:32.916 --> 57:35.126
- T'su'tey. - Tsu'tey.

57:35.216 --> 57:37.926
- Tsu'tey. - He'll be the next clan leader.

57:39.966 --> 57:42.426
- Neytiri. - She'll be the next Tsahik.

57:42.516 --> 57:44.516
They become a mated pair.

57:45.516 --> 57:47.766
- So who's this Eywa? - Who's Eywa?

57:48.686 --> 57:52.266
Only their deity. Their goddess, made up of all living things.

57:52.356 --> 57:53.726
Everything they know!

57:53.776 --> 57:55.896
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.

57:55.986 --> 57:57.356
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?

57:57.406 --> 57:59.106
Come on. That's...

57:59.656 --> 58:01.776
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten around here.

58:03.866 --> 58:06.826
Neytiri was my best student.

58:06.906 --> 58:09.916
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

58:09.996 --> 58:12.416
Just amazing girls.

58:12.496 --> 58:14.086
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

58:15.006 --> 58:16.046
She's dead.

58:19.926 --> 58:22.466
Let's go. Village life starts early.

58:24.676 --> 58:27.176
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

58:46.366 --> 58:47.696
Easy, boy.

58:48.326 --> 58:50.416
Pale is female.

58:53.376 --> 58:55.796
Okay. Easy, girl.

59:24.576 --> 59:28.326
That is shahaylu. The bond.

59:30.496 --> 59:31.746
Feel her.

59:34.876 --> 59:39.006
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

59:42.006 --> 59:43.796
Feel her strong legs.

59:46.256 --> 59:48.596
You may tell her what to do.

59:48.676 --> 59:49.886
Inside.

59:50.846 --> 59:53.766
For now, say where to go.

59:56.766 --> 59:58.016
Forward!

01:00:15.626 --> 01:00:18.746
- You should go away. - No, you'd miss me.

01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:22.466
I knew you could speak English.

01:00:25.046 --> 01:00:27.216
This alien will learn nothing...

01:00:27.636 --> 01:00:29.256
...a rock sees more...

01:00:29.636 --> 01:00:31.516
...look at him.

01:00:40.776 --> 01:00:41.856
Again.

01:00:41.936 --> 01:00:45.446
If you want to hit this thing, it's gonna be complicated.

01:00:45.446 --> 01:00:47.946
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.

01:00:48.026 --> 01:00:50.156
There's an outer row of columns.

01:00:50.156 --> 01:00:52.996
Real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here,

01:00:52.996 --> 01:00:56.626
and an inner ring. There's a core structure like a spiral.

01:00:57.496 --> 01:00:59.126
That's how they move up and down.

01:00:59.206 --> 01:01:02.126
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.

01:01:02.126 --> 01:01:03.506
Roger that.

01:01:03.586 --> 01:01:06.296
What else can you tell us about the structure?

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:09.136
I'm guessing this secondary ring, that's also load-bearing.

01:01:13.676 --> 01:01:17.146
- So where are we going? - Getting out of Dodge.

01:01:18.516 --> 01:01:22.686
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

01:01:22.776 --> 01:01:26.026
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of,

01:01:26.106 --> 01:01:28.066
way up in the mountains.

01:01:28.816 --> 01:01:31.196
The Hallelujah Mountains?

01:01:31.196 --> 01:01:33.496
- That's right. - Are you serious?

01:01:33.576 --> 01:01:35.536
- Yeah. - Yes!

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:42.666
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora. Heard of them?

01:01:56.186 --> 01:01:58.056
We're getting close.

01:01:58.146 --> 01:02:00.856
Yeah, look at my instruments.

01:02:00.856 --> 01:02:03.896
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

01:02:03.896 --> 01:02:06.236
We're VFR from here on.

01:02:06.236 --> 01:02:08.196
What's VFR?

01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:10.566
Means you gotta see where you're going.

01:02:10.656 --> 01:02:14.576
- You can't see anything. - Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

01:02:33.056 --> 01:02:35.716
Oh, my God.

01:02:46.736 --> 01:02:48.106
You should see your faces.

01:03:15.136 --> 01:03:17.556
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

01:03:30.566 --> 01:03:33.276
So what does hold them up?

01:03:33.366 --> 01:03:34.816
Grace explained it to me.

01:03:35.576 --> 01:03:37.486
Some kind of maglev effect.

01:03:37.576 --> 01:03:41.406
Because unobtanium is a superconductor... or something.

01:04:03.976 --> 01:04:05.556
Welcome to camp.

01:04:09.396 --> 01:04:14.066
- So, this is my bunk. - This stuff is nasty.

01:04:15.366 --> 01:04:17.406
- Norm, go under. - All right.

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:21.036
- Grace didn't miss a thing. - Trudy, you'll take the top one.

01:04:21.036 --> 01:04:23.536
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

01:04:23.536 --> 01:04:27.246
But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan,

01:04:27.246 --> 01:04:28.876
so she's playing nice.

01:04:28.956 --> 01:04:34.046
All right. Jake, hang a left. You'll be in the link at the end.

01:04:36.926 --> 01:04:41.016
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.566
Holy shit!

01:05:32.436 --> 01:05:34.356
Do not look in her eye.

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:44.616
Ikran is not horse.

01:05:45.786 --> 01:05:47.616
Once shahaylu is made,

01:05:51.496 --> 01:05:55.836
ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.

01:06:05.766 --> 01:06:08.516
To become taronyu, hunter,

01:06:08.596 --> 01:06:12.186
you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you.

01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:16.776
- When? - When you are ready.

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:10.326
Okay. This is video log 12.

01:07:11.496 --> 01:07:13.206
Time's 2132.

01:07:14.626 --> 01:07:18.046
Do I have to do this now? I really need to get some rack.

01:07:18.046 --> 01:07:20.926
No, now. When it's fresh.

01:07:23.546 --> 01:07:25.426
Okay, location, shack,

01:07:26.386 --> 01:07:28.726
and the days are starting to blur together.

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:34.106
The language is a pain, but, you know,

01:07:34.106 --> 01:07:37.316
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Just repetition, repetition.

01:07:37.396 --> 01:07:39.066
- Navi. - "Nari."

01:07:39.066 --> 01:07:41.396
- Nari. - "Narrri"!

01:07:41.406 --> 01:07:42.696
Narrri!

01:07:43.616 --> 01:07:45.656
Txurni'ul. Stronger.

01:07:50.246 --> 01:07:53.916
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

01:07:56.246 --> 01:07:57.746
This is a very important part of it.

01:07:57.756 --> 01:07:59.956
- Norm's attitude has improved lately. - I see you. I see you.

01:07:59.966 --> 01:08:02.426
But it's not just, "I'm seeing you in front of me,"

01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:04.086
it's "I see into you. I See you."

01:08:04.176 --> 01:08:06.846
It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

01:08:06.926 --> 01:08:09.176
"I'm accepting you. I understand you." So you gotta get this, okay?

01:08:09.516 --> 01:08:12.476
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

01:08:13.266 --> 01:08:16.856
My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day.

01:08:18.726 --> 01:08:21.856
I have to trust my body to know what to do.

01:08:26.946 --> 01:08:28.696
Yeah! Check it out!

01:08:29.496 --> 01:08:30.786
Oh, crap!

01:08:35.036 --> 01:08:39.956
Every day it's reading the trails, the tracks at the waterhole,

01:08:39.956 --> 01:08:42.216
the tiniest scents and sounds.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:52.556
She's always going on about the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

01:08:53.306 --> 01:08:56.016
I really hope this tree-hugger crap isn't on the final.

01:08:56.106 --> 01:08:59.816
This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there, you know.

01:08:59.816 --> 01:09:02.526
You need to listen to what she says.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:05.816
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

01:09:05.816 --> 01:09:08.446
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

01:09:23.836 --> 01:09:26.426
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

01:09:27.676 --> 01:09:29.846
You gotta be kidding me.

01:09:58.876 --> 01:10:00.916
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.

01:10:01.046 --> 01:10:03.266
Look how big you are.

01:10:03.356 --> 01:10:04.666
It's the first time since her school was closed down.

01:10:04.756 --> 01:10:06.506
You are so pretty.

01:10:35.746 --> 01:10:37.326
Come on, Marine.

01:11:02.556 --> 01:11:05.266
I'm trying to understand this deep connection

01:11:05.356 --> 01:11:07.566
the people have to the forest.

01:11:08.026 --> 01:11:10.856
She talks about a network of energy

01:11:11.696 --> 01:11:14.276
that flows through all living things.

01:11:15.156 --> 01:11:18.496
She says all energy is only borrowed,

01:11:19.366 --> 01:11:21.996
and one day you have to give it back.

01:12:03.076 --> 01:12:05.536
You were in 16 hours today.

01:12:08.416 --> 01:12:10.416
You're still losing weight.

01:12:14.926 --> 01:12:16.596
No, you don't.

01:12:16.636 --> 01:12:19.386
- I gotta get some sleep. - Come back here.

01:12:21.596 --> 01:12:23.056
Bon appetit.

01:12:25.436 --> 01:12:26.976
Today I made a kill.

01:12:27.896 --> 01:12:30.776
And we ate it. At least, I know where that meal came from.

01:12:31.106 --> 01:12:35.276
Other body. You need to take care of this body. Okay?

01:12:35.366 --> 01:12:37.066
- Get it? Let's eat it. - Yeah, yeah.

01:12:37.656 --> 01:12:40.076
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

01:12:40.116 --> 01:12:42.366
Give it to me.

01:12:42.456 --> 01:12:43.956
- You look like crap. - Thank you.

01:12:44.036 --> 01:12:45.786
You're burning way too hard.

01:12:46.876 --> 01:12:48.706
Get rid of this shit.

01:12:48.796 --> 01:12:50.706
And then you can lecture me.

01:12:51.796 --> 01:12:54.506
Now, I'm telling you, as your boss,

01:12:55.966 --> 01:12:59.306
and as someone who might even consider being a friend someday

01:12:59.386 --> 01:13:01.806
to take some down time.

01:13:01.886 --> 01:13:03.636
Eat this, please.

01:13:05.146 --> 01:13:08.396
Trust me, I... learned the hard way.

01:13:22.996 --> 01:13:25.576
What did happen at the school, Grace?

01:13:33.756 --> 01:13:39.386
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin, stopped coming to school.

01:13:39.466 --> 01:13:41.506
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

01:13:43.516 --> 01:13:46.886
And one day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in

01:13:46.976 --> 01:13:50.106
all painted up.

01:13:50.186 --> 01:13:52.816
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

01:13:56.146 --> 01:13:59.026
I guess they thought I could protect them.

01:14:01.826 --> 01:14:04.656
The troopers pursued them to the school.

01:14:05.826 --> 01:14:08.036
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:10.416
Right in front of Neytiri.

01:14:10.496 --> 01:14:11.666
And then shot the others.

01:14:14.456 --> 01:14:15.966
I got most of the kids out.

01:14:20.006 --> 01:14:21.636
But they never came back.

01:14:25.476 --> 01:14:26.476
I'm sorry.

01:14:35.066 --> 01:14:38.856
A scientist stays objective.

01:14:39.696 --> 01:14:43.576
We can't be ruled by emotion.

01:14:43.616 --> 01:14:46.826
But I put 10 years of my life into that school.

01:14:47.826 --> 01:14:50.576
They called me sa'nok.

01:14:52.666 --> 01:14:53.666
Mother.

01:14:53.746 --> 01:14:54.746
Mother.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:15:01.586
That kind of pain reaches back through the link.

01:15:27.036 --> 01:15:28.156
I see you...

01:15:28.246 --> 01:15:29.456
...Brother

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:32.116
...and thank you.

01:15:36.246 --> 01:15:38.126
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

01:15:38.666 --> 01:15:40.506
Your body stays behind...

01:15:40.796 --> 01:15:43.466
...to become part of The People.

01:15:47.136 --> 01:15:48.636
A clean kill.

01:15:51.976 --> 01:15:53.476
You are ready.

01:16:19.126 --> 01:16:22.506
Learning to ride an ikran, we call them banshees,

01:16:22.586 --> 01:16:25.176
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

01:16:27.386 --> 01:16:30.716
But to do that, you gotta go where the banshees are.

01:16:31.556 --> 01:16:32.766
Oo-rah.

01:17:04.256 --> 01:17:05.506
Now what?

01:18:53.616 --> 01:18:55.576
Jakesully will go first.

01:19:28.446 --> 01:19:32.446
Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside.

01:19:33.366 --> 01:19:36.326
If he also chooses you, move quick like I showed.

01:19:36.406 --> 01:19:39.286
You will have one chance, Jake.

01:19:39.286 --> 01:19:41.456
How will I know if he chooses me?

01:19:41.536 --> 01:19:43.496
He will try to kill you.

01:19:44.666 --> 01:19:46.086
Outstanding.

01:20:46.356 --> 01:20:47.766
Let's dance.

01:20:53.906 --> 01:20:55.776
That moron's going to die.

01:21:19.636 --> 01:21:21.596
Don't be afraid, warrior.

01:21:21.596 --> 01:21:23.096
Make the bond!

01:21:26.396 --> 01:21:27.436
No!

01:21:31.396 --> 01:21:32.526
Jake!

01:21:46.536 --> 01:21:48.166
Shahaylu, Jake.

01:21:50.546 --> 01:21:51.796
Shahaylu!

01:22:01.886 --> 01:22:03.016
Stop!

01:22:11.646 --> 01:22:16.736
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

01:22:29.956 --> 01:22:32.916
First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:36.586
- Think, "Fly!" - Fly?

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:46.476
God damn!

01:22:50.896 --> 01:22:52.146
Oh, shit!

01:23:01.616 --> 01:23:03.776
Shut up and fly straight!

01:23:14.046 --> 01:23:16.376
That's it. Bank left!

01:23:25.676 --> 01:23:27.466
Level out! That's it.

01:23:32.976 --> 01:23:34.306
Jakesully!

01:23:59.086 --> 01:24:00.166
Hey!

01:24:06.176 --> 01:24:07.506
Let's go!

01:24:19.936 --> 01:24:21.856
Yeah, baby, I got this!

01:24:22.696 --> 01:24:23.946
Oh, shit!

01:24:29.246 --> 01:24:32.996
I may not be much of a horse guy, but I was born to do this.

01:24:33.826 --> 01:24:34.916
Yeah!

01:24:35.876 --> 01:24:39.046
- I came like this. This you. - Yeah, yeah.

01:24:39.046 --> 01:24:44.046
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong. - Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

01:25:46.106 --> 01:25:48.116
The Tree of Souls.

01:25:51.536 --> 01:25:53.746
It's their most sacred place.

01:25:54.496 --> 01:25:57.326
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?

01:25:57.416 --> 01:25:59.496
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

01:25:59.586 --> 01:26:04.126
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.

01:26:05.506 --> 01:26:07.586
I would die to get samples.

01:26:08.176 --> 01:26:11.006
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

01:26:11.096 --> 01:26:12.426
You lucky swine.

01:27:33.796 --> 01:27:34.886
Hell, yeah!

01:27:34.966 --> 01:27:36.516
Hell, yeah!

01:27:49.316 --> 01:27:53.026
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter. Death from above.

01:27:54.366 --> 01:27:57.366
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

01:28:01.326 --> 01:28:02.416
Dive!

01:28:25.186 --> 01:28:26.396
Go, go!

01:28:34.566 --> 01:28:35.906
Follow me!

01:29:22.326 --> 01:29:24.956
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

01:29:25.826 --> 01:29:28.876
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

01:29:30.626 --> 01:29:33.756
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

01:29:38.346 --> 01:29:42.136
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.

01:29:42.806 --> 01:29:44.596
Rider of Last Shadow.

01:29:45.976 --> 01:29:47.436
He rode this?

01:29:49.066 --> 01:29:50.686
Toruk chose him.

01:29:51.026 --> 01:29:54.896
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.

01:29:54.986 --> 01:29:56.986
- That's a long time. - Yes.

01:29:57.696 --> 01:29:59.566
Toruk Macto was mighty.

01:30:01.406 --> 01:30:05.246
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.

01:30:05.246 --> 01:30:07.576
All Na'vi people know the story.

01:30:14.296 --> 01:30:18.506
Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world

01:30:19.636 --> 01:30:21.636
and in here is the dream.

01:30:42.326 --> 01:30:45.036
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.

01:30:48.076 --> 01:30:50.536
I can barely remember my old life.

01:30:54.086 --> 01:30:55.916
I don't know who I am anymore.

01:31:14.686 --> 01:31:17.526
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

01:31:20.696 --> 01:31:23.616
Your last report was more than two weeks ago.

01:31:25.826 --> 01:31:28.326
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

01:31:30.916 --> 01:31:33.496
The way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission.

01:31:33.496 --> 01:31:35.376
No, I can do this.

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:37.086
You already have.

01:31:38.006 --> 01:31:40.296
You give me good, usable intel.

01:31:40.296 --> 01:31:42.506
This Tree of Souls place.

01:31:42.966 --> 01:31:46.346
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight

01:31:46.426 --> 01:31:48.176
which it will. Yeah.

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:51.136
Now it's time to come in.

01:31:52.606 --> 01:31:54.476
By the way,

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:56.976
you gonna get your legs back.

01:31:57.856 --> 01:32:01.526
Yeah. I got your corporate approval. It's a done deal.

01:32:01.526 --> 01:32:03.986
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

01:32:04.066 --> 01:32:05.866
I'm a man of my word.

01:32:08.786 --> 01:32:10.536
I gotta finish this.

01:32:12.826 --> 01:32:14.376
There's one more thing.

01:32:15.086 --> 01:32:20.046
Ceremony. It's the final stage of becoming a man.

01:32:22.546 --> 01:32:24.676
If I do it, I'm one of them.

01:32:26.176 --> 01:32:27.966
And they'll trust me.

01:32:31.596 --> 01:32:34.806
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.

01:32:48.406 --> 01:32:50.906
Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.

01:33:08.346 --> 01:33:12.346
The Na'vi say that every person is born twice.

01:33:14.346 --> 01:33:19.766
The second time is when you earn your place among The People forever.

01:33:25.276 --> 01:33:29.576
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

01:33:30.786 --> 01:33:34.036
You are part of The People.

01:34:20.336 --> 01:34:22.336
Come. Come.

01:34:39.976 --> 01:34:42.686
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

01:34:44.316 --> 01:34:46.186
And sometimes answered.

01:34:54.036 --> 01:34:56.746
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

01:34:57.746 --> 01:34:59.496
The Tree of Voices.

01:35:01.496 --> 01:35:03.666
The voices of our ancestors.

01:35:18.686 --> 01:35:20.266
I can hear them.

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:26.816
They live, Jake,

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.276
within Eywa.

01:35:34.446 --> 01:35:36.326
You are Omaticaya now.

01:35:37.036 --> 01:35:40.156
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.

01:35:45.666 --> 01:35:47.756
And you may choose a woman.

01:35:49.876 --> 01:35:51.836
We have many fine women.

01:35:53.046 --> 01:35:55.046
Ninat is the best singer.

01:35:57.926 --> 01:35:59.846
But I don't want Ninat.

01:36:04.146 --> 01:36:06.106
Beyral is a good hunter.

01:36:07.776 --> 01:36:09.856
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

01:36:11.946 --> 01:36:13.696
I've already chosen.

01:36:17.196 --> 01:36:19.696
But this woman must also choose me.

01:36:23.706 --> 01:36:25.326
She already has.

01:37:19.766 --> 01:37:21.716
I am with you now, Jake.

01:37:23.266 --> 01:37:25.136
We are mated for life.

01:37:31.436 --> 01:37:33.486
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

01:38:03.926 --> 01:38:05.056
Ma Jake!

01:38:05.136 --> 01:38:06.436
Don't forget your phase integration.

01:38:06.516 --> 01:38:07.846
- Jake! - No, no, the middle button.

01:38:07.936 --> 01:38:09.856
- You gotta eat something. - Yeah, there you go.

01:38:18.276 --> 01:38:23.236
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

01:38:23.866 --> 01:38:26.366
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

01:38:27.536 --> 01:38:29.126
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

01:38:32.916 --> 01:38:34.046
Jake!

01:38:42.966 --> 01:38:44.056
Okay.

01:38:55.146 --> 01:38:57.236
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

01:38:57.236 --> 01:38:59.566
And when was the last time you took a shower?

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:01.656
- I don't need a shower. - Jesus, Marine.

01:39:05.786 --> 01:39:07.076
Jake!

01:39:13.836 --> 01:39:18.756
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:23.596
Hey!

01:39:24.256 --> 01:39:26.766
Stop! Stop!

01:39:26.766 --> 01:39:29.596
- Jake! - Go back, stop!

01:39:33.766 --> 01:39:35.106
Hey, boss.

01:39:35.606 --> 01:39:36.776
Hey!

01:39:39.356 --> 01:39:40.446
- What? - I got a native

01:39:40.526 --> 01:39:43.486
doing the funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade.

01:39:43.576 --> 01:39:46.696
Well, keep going. He'll move.

01:39:46.786 --> 01:39:50.036
These people have to learn that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

01:39:52.376 --> 01:39:54.586
Stop! Hey!

01:39:54.666 --> 01:39:56.956
Go! Go!

01:39:57.966 --> 01:39:59.416
There, see? He moved.

01:40:11.806 --> 01:40:14.686
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

01:40:14.686 --> 01:40:15.686
I'm blind.

01:40:27.616 --> 01:40:29.866
- Jake! - Neytiri!

01:40:31.456 --> 01:40:33.116
Here, come on!

01:40:58.026 --> 01:41:00.606
Freeze it right there.

01:41:02.196 --> 01:41:04.656
Scale up. Enhance.

01:41:06.276 --> 01:41:07.826
Son of a bitch.

01:41:09.326 --> 01:41:10.786
Unbelievable.

01:41:11.866 --> 01:41:13.996
- Get me a pilot. - Yes, sir.

01:41:20.796 --> 01:41:22.966
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

01:41:29.556 --> 01:41:30.846
Stop please!

01:41:32.346 --> 01:41:34.476
This will only make it worse.

01:41:34.596 --> 01:41:36.266
You do not speak here!

01:41:37.436 --> 01:41:39.226
We will strike them in the heart.

01:41:47.026 --> 01:41:49.196
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

01:41:52.326 --> 01:41:53.866
- You! - Listen. Brother...

01:41:59.336 --> 01:42:02.506
- You mated with this woman? - Oh, shit.

01:42:03.756 --> 01:42:05.756
Is this true?

01:42:07.256 --> 01:42:10.466
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

01:42:11.846 --> 01:42:13.016
Brother, please.

01:42:13.096 --> 01:42:16.936
Do not attack the Sky People. Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

01:42:16.936 --> 01:42:19.266
You are not my brother!

01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:24.236
And I am not your enemy!

01:42:25.856 --> 01:42:28.736
The enemy is out there, and they are very powerful!

01:42:30.986 --> 01:42:32.786
Go! Go! Go!

01:42:35.996 --> 01:42:38.496
- I can talk to them. - No more talk.

01:42:38.496 --> 01:42:39.916
Tsu'tey!

01:42:46.126 --> 01:42:49.046
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

01:42:49.846 --> 01:42:52.096
And I have the right to speak.

01:42:56.726 --> 01:42:58.596
I have something to say...

01:43:00.936 --> 01:43:02.396
...to all of you.

01:43:06.436 --> 01:43:08.526
The words are like stones in my heart.

01:43:12.866 --> 01:43:14.866
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

01:43:14.866 --> 01:43:17.156
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

01:43:18.326 --> 01:43:19.666
It's very dangerous!

01:43:22.286 --> 01:43:23.456
Grace!

01:43:24.666 --> 01:43:25.876
Oh, no.

01:43:26.086 --> 01:43:28.086
- Wait! - Stay down, sir.

01:43:29.586 --> 01:43:31.836
Okay. Look...

01:43:32.926 --> 01:43:34.256
I was sent here to...

01:43:37.886 --> 01:43:39.306
You see?

01:43:39.476 --> 01:43:41.936
It is a demon in a false body.

01:44:01.826 --> 01:44:05.206
- Are you out of your goddamn mind? - You crossed the line.

01:44:08.666 --> 01:44:10.836
Wheel this meat out of here.

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:15.096
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

01:44:18.346 --> 01:44:20.136
You let me down, son.

01:44:22.096 --> 01:44:23.396
So, what,

01:44:24.896 --> 01:44:26.936
you find yourself some local tail

01:44:26.936 --> 01:44:30.146
and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?

01:44:30.236 --> 01:44:32.736
Parker, there is time to salvage the situation.

01:44:32.816 --> 01:44:35.406
- Parker... - Shut your pie hole!

01:44:35.406 --> 01:44:39.616
Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me?

01:44:39.696 --> 01:44:42.456
- I could do that. - You need to muzzle your dog.

01:44:42.536 --> 01:44:45.286
Yeah, can we just take this down a couple of notches, please?

01:44:45.376 --> 01:44:47.916
You say you want to keep your people alive?

01:44:47.916 --> 01:44:49.956
You start by listening to her.

01:44:50.046 --> 01:44:52.336
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

01:44:52.426 --> 01:44:54.256
- in a way you can't imagine. - You know what?

01:44:54.256 --> 01:44:56.636
You throw a stick in the air around here,

01:44:56.636 --> 01:44:59.636
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

01:44:59.716 --> 01:45:01.136
- for Christ's sake! - I'm not talking

01:45:01.136 --> 01:45:05.646
about some kind of pagan voodoo here. I'm talking about something real,

01:45:05.646 --> 01:45:07.816
something measurable in the biology of the forest.

01:45:07.816 --> 01:45:08.316
Something measurable in the biology of the forest.

01:45:08.396 --> 01:45:09.896
Which is what, exactly?

01:45:10.936 --> 01:45:12.316
What we think we know

01:45:12.316 --> 01:45:15.776
is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:20.196
between the roots of the trees, like the synapses between neurons.

01:45:20.286 --> 01:45:24.866
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.

01:45:24.956 --> 01:45:28.126
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

01:45:28.996 --> 01:45:31.336
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

01:45:31.336 --> 01:45:33.756
It's more connections than the human brain.

01:45:34.926 --> 01:45:37.506
Get it? It's a network.

01:45:37.506 --> 01:45:40.556
It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it.

01:45:40.636 --> 01:45:44.176
They can upload and download data. Memories.

01:45:44.186 --> 01:45:46.936
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

01:45:47.516 --> 01:45:48.606
Yes!

01:45:49.816 --> 01:45:53.936
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?

01:45:54.566 --> 01:45:56.656
They're just goddamn trees!

01:45:58.406 --> 01:46:01.196
- You need to wake up, Parker. - No. You need to wake up.

01:46:01.196 --> 01:46:05.706
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground. It's all around us.

01:46:05.786 --> 01:46:09.496
The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.

01:46:09.586 --> 01:46:13.876
If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them.

01:46:13.966 --> 01:46:18.676
I'd say we understand them just fine, thanks to Jake here.

01:46:20.386 --> 01:46:22.846
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

01:46:22.926 --> 01:46:25.176
They're not gonna give up their home.

01:46:26.976 --> 01:46:28.646
They're not gonna make a deal.

01:46:29.686 --> 01:46:31.976
For what? Lite beer?

01:46:32.566 --> 01:46:34.106
And blue jeans?

01:46:37.356 --> 01:46:40.236
There's nothing that we have that they want.

01:46:42.156 --> 01:46:45.196
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.

01:46:50.126 --> 01:46:51.536
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

01:46:54.416 --> 01:47:00.426
So, since a deal can't be made, I guess things get real simple.

01:47:00.636 --> 01:47:05.136
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

01:47:05.176 --> 01:47:07.806
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

01:47:33.496 --> 01:47:35.206
Talk to me, Lyle.

01:47:35.546 --> 01:47:38.086
It looks like they hit it with banshees first.

01:47:38.216 --> 01:47:39.876
See the angle's steep?

01:47:44.136 --> 01:47:46.136
They set the ampsuit on fire.

01:47:46.516 --> 01:47:47.716
Driver's toast.

01:47:49.226 --> 01:47:50.976
The rest of the squad?

01:47:52.146 --> 01:47:55.066
Six bodies. That's all of them.

01:47:56.526 --> 01:47:57.726
The equipment's totaled.

01:48:00.566 --> 01:48:03.026
Jesus Christ.

01:48:06.196 --> 01:48:09.576
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.

01:48:10.456 --> 01:48:12.956
I'll drive them out with gas first.

01:48:14.206 --> 01:48:15.786
It'll be humane.

01:48:17.416 --> 01:48:18.876
More or less.

01:48:20.586 --> 01:48:22.426
All right, let's pull the trigger.

01:48:25.886 --> 01:48:28.266
Come on, people. Let's get it packed, let's go.

01:48:28.596 --> 01:48:31.766
You know, they never even wanted us to succeed.

01:48:32.596 --> 01:48:38.146
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose to trigger a response.

01:48:38.226 --> 01:48:40.936
Just fabricating this war to get what they want.

01:48:41.526 --> 01:48:43.406
This is how it's done.

01:48:46.196 --> 01:48:49.496
When people are sitting on shit that you want,

01:48:49.576 --> 01:48:53.616
you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it.

01:48:53.706 --> 01:48:56.996
Quaritch is rolling the gunships. He's gonna hit Hometree.

01:48:57.086 --> 01:48:58.086
My God.

01:49:04.546 --> 01:49:08.806
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here! - Back off!

01:49:08.806 --> 01:49:12.596
Parker. Wait. Stop. These are people you're about to...

01:49:12.596 --> 01:49:13.766
- No. No, no, no, no. - I said back off!

01:49:13.766 --> 01:49:17.266
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!

01:49:17.266 --> 01:49:18.976
All right? Look around!

01:49:19.066 --> 01:49:22.776
I don't know about you, but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:24.316
- Can you guys just please... - Yes, sir.

01:49:24.406 --> 01:49:26.986
There are families in there. There are children. Babies.

01:49:26.986 --> 01:49:28.276
Are you gonna kill children?

01:49:28.366 --> 01:49:32.286
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands. Believe me.

01:49:32.366 --> 01:49:34.786
Just let me try to talk them out.

01:49:35.576 --> 01:49:37.076
They trust me.

01:49:40.336 --> 01:49:42.836
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

01:49:42.836 --> 01:49:44.836
Calibrating three and four.

01:49:44.836 --> 01:49:47.796
- Run sequence. - Initiating. Thirty seconds.

01:49:52.176 --> 01:49:53.976
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

01:49:53.976 --> 01:49:56.646
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down,

01:49:56.646 --> 01:49:59.306
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

01:50:05.356 --> 01:50:06.486
Father!

01:50:06.656 --> 01:50:07.696
Mother!

01:50:07.696 --> 01:50:10.946
Eytukan, I have something to say.

01:50:11.036 --> 01:50:12.446
Listen!

01:50:13.496 --> 01:50:14.956
Speak, Jakesully.

01:50:16.326 --> 01:50:19.286
A great evil is upon us...

01:50:19.626 --> 01:50:21.496
The Sky People are coming...

01:50:21.746 --> 01:50:24.256
...to destroy Hometree.

01:50:26.716 --> 01:50:28.176
Look, tell them they're gonna be here soon.

01:50:30.716 --> 01:50:33.556
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

01:50:33.556 --> 01:50:35.516
Are you certain of this?

01:50:39.306 --> 01:50:43.026
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

01:50:44.186 --> 01:50:47.486
so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it.

01:50:50.026 --> 01:50:53.656
What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen?

01:50:56.866 --> 01:50:58.416
Yes.

01:50:58.416 --> 01:51:00.876
Look, at first it was just orders,

01:51:02.376 --> 01:51:04.756
and then everything changed.

01:51:04.756 --> 01:51:06.546
Okay? I fell in love.

01:51:07.216 --> 01:51:12.506
I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people.

01:51:13.676 --> 01:51:15.136
And with you.

01:51:16.096 --> 01:51:17.926
- I trusted you. - With you. With you.

01:51:18.016 --> 01:51:20.896
- I trusted you! - Trust me now, please.

01:51:28.236 --> 01:51:30.736
You will never be one of The People!

01:51:30.736 --> 01:51:32.616
- I shouldn't have... - We tried to stop them!

01:51:32.616 --> 01:51:34.656
Neytiri, please! Please.

01:51:39.576 --> 01:51:40.746
Bind them.

01:51:42.376 --> 01:51:43.496
Leave now!

01:51:43.666 --> 01:51:47.006
You have to go. They're coming!

01:52:00.846 --> 01:52:03.106
Time on target, one mike.

01:52:03.106 --> 01:52:05.146
Copy. We have a visual.

01:52:05.146 --> 01:52:08.186
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

01:52:08.276 --> 01:52:09.606
Roger, 030.

01:52:23.416 --> 01:52:25.456
- Run to the forest! - They're coming!

01:52:27.086 --> 01:52:30.916
- They will destroy this place. - Neytiri, you must go now!

01:52:34.676 --> 01:52:36.966
Run to the forest! Run!

01:52:39.346 --> 01:52:40.676
Run! Run!

01:52:40.686 --> 01:52:44.346
Have no fear.

01:53:01.206 --> 01:53:04.956
No! God damn it, run!

01:53:05.166 --> 01:53:06.706
Take the ikran...

01:53:06.706 --> 01:53:08.296
...attack from above.

01:53:12.546 --> 01:53:14.756
That is one big damn tree.

01:53:22.266 --> 01:53:26.476
Well, well, well. I'd say diplomacy has failed.

01:53:28.436 --> 01:53:30.526
All right, people, let's get this done!

01:53:30.606 --> 01:53:33.526
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.

01:53:33.526 --> 01:53:35.566
Roger. CS.40's going hot.

01:53:35.946 --> 01:53:37.156
- Fire. - Firing.

01:53:48.586 --> 01:53:50.626
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

01:53:58.546 --> 01:54:00.216
Sir, they've opened fire.

01:54:02.096 --> 01:54:03.846
You've got to be kidding me!

01:54:16.406 --> 01:54:18.906
These dumb bastards ain't getting the message.

01:54:18.986 --> 01:54:20.736
All right, let's turn up the heat.

01:54:20.736 --> 01:54:23.746
- Switch incendiaries! - Switching incendiaries.

01:54:23.746 --> 01:54:24.866
Fire.

01:54:28.166 --> 01:54:29.246
No!

01:54:42.466 --> 01:54:44.216
Get everyone to the forest.

01:54:47.596 --> 01:54:49.806
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

01:54:53.566 --> 01:54:54.776
Neytiri!

01:55:03.446 --> 01:55:06.496
We gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns!

01:55:06.576 --> 01:55:07.866
My God!

01:55:26.426 --> 01:55:29.806
- Mo'at! No! - Lf you are one of us,

01:55:31.306 --> 01:55:32.646
help us.

01:55:40.406 --> 01:55:42.406
All call signs, switch missiles.

01:55:42.576 --> 01:55:44.986
Give me HE's at the base of the west columns.

01:55:46.946 --> 01:55:48.196
This way!

01:55:49.326 --> 01:55:51.206
Rider section, switch missiles.

01:55:51.286 --> 01:55:53.246
- One's good. - Two's rocks up.

01:55:53.336 --> 01:55:55.876
- Three's up. - Yeah, baby, get some!

01:55:56.416 --> 01:55:58.666
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

01:55:58.756 --> 01:56:00.176
- Bring it down. - Cleared hot.

01:56:07.216 --> 01:56:08.806
Come on, Grace, move!

01:56:11.436 --> 01:56:13.016
Down! Head down!

01:56:15.606 --> 01:56:17.856
Come on, come on! Down!

01:56:22.616 --> 01:56:24.616
- Solid hits. - Solid rocks on target.

01:56:24.696 --> 01:56:25.866
Screw this.

01:56:27.116 --> 01:56:29.116
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

01:56:29.206 --> 01:56:30.996
I didn't sign up for this shit!

01:56:40.676 --> 01:56:42.546
Repeat. Ripple fire.

01:57:26.096 --> 01:57:27.636
Go! Go! Go!

01:58:00.756 --> 01:58:03.206
No, no, get back! Back!

01:58:22.226 --> 01:58:24.816
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

01:59:09.816 --> 01:59:13.446
That's good work, people. First round's on me tonight.

01:59:14.116 --> 01:59:15.366
Let's boogie.

01:59:15.786 --> 01:59:18.206
Dragon coming left, heading home.

01:59:18.666 --> 01:59:20.576
Gunrunner coming left.

01:59:20.666 --> 01:59:23.206
- Thunder copies. - Rider section copies.

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:31.886
Father!

01:59:47.736 --> 01:59:49.066
Daughter...

01:59:50.236 --> 01:59:53.316
take... my... bow.

01:59:57.446 --> 02:00:01.916
Protect The People.

02:00:10.296 --> 02:00:11.546
Neytiri!

02:00:21.596 --> 02:00:25.316
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Get away.

02:00:25.976 --> 02:00:27.276
Get away!

02:00:28.356 --> 02:00:30.106
Get away from here!

02:00:31.566 --> 02:00:33.156
Never come back!

02:00:50.836 --> 02:00:51.966
Pull the plug.

02:00:52.966 --> 02:00:55.636
- No, you can't do that! - You can't do that!

02:00:55.636 --> 02:00:57.636
- Calm down! Calm down! - No! Please!

02:01:13.816 --> 02:01:16.366
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.

02:01:17.786 --> 02:01:21.656
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

02:01:24.496 --> 02:01:25.956
Let's go!

02:01:33.796 --> 02:01:35.386
Put him down!

02:01:38.756 --> 02:01:41.516
You murderer!

02:02:28.146 --> 02:02:30.226
What's going on, brother? Long time no see.

02:02:30.316 --> 02:02:31.396
Hey.

02:02:32.736 --> 02:02:35.446
Personally, I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

02:02:35.526 --> 02:02:38.906
They get steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that.

02:02:39.906 --> 02:02:42.446
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

02:02:42.536 --> 02:02:45.076
- Trudy! - All the way down.

02:02:48.456 --> 02:02:49.706
Max!

02:02:59.756 --> 02:03:02.256
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

02:03:02.846 --> 02:03:03.926
Here.

02:03:16.026 --> 02:03:18.486
- Clear. Come on. - Here you go.

02:03:34.046 --> 02:03:38.006
Max, stay here. I need someone on the inside I can trust.

02:03:38.006 --> 02:03:39.296
Okay. Go.

02:03:53.106 --> 02:03:54.266
Clear.

02:03:56.236 --> 02:03:57.526
Come on, baby.

02:03:57.526 --> 02:04:00.316
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

02:04:03.946 --> 02:04:06.986
It's Samson 1-6. Unauthorized engine start.

02:04:10.036 --> 02:04:11.326
Three!

02:04:14.166 --> 02:04:15.376
Come on!

02:04:17.336 --> 02:04:18.666
Mask on!

02:04:21.256 --> 02:04:23.086
Gas, gas, gas!

02:04:24.716 --> 02:04:26.756
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

02:04:29.226 --> 02:04:32.346
Grab my hand! Come on, we're in. Let's go!

02:04:33.356 --> 02:04:35.186
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

02:04:47.826 --> 02:04:49.156
Colonel!

02:04:55.876 --> 02:04:59.416
- Yeah! Yeah! - All right! Yes!

02:05:02.626 --> 02:05:05.296
- Crap. - Everybody all right back there?

02:05:05.386 --> 02:05:06.926
Oh, yeah, baby!

02:05:06.926 --> 02:05:08.846
- Norm, you good? - Yeah!

02:05:09.726 --> 02:05:12.056
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

02:05:12.306 --> 02:05:14.096
- Grace is hit! - What?

02:05:15.226 --> 02:05:16.896
- Get the trauma kit. - Trauma kit!

02:05:16.896 --> 02:05:20.396
- Keep the pressure on, Grace. - Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

02:05:20.486 --> 02:05:24.986
- Hang on, Grace. - Doesn't matter. It's fine.

02:05:28.326 --> 02:05:30.786
- You're good to go. - Take it up!

02:05:31.956 --> 02:05:33.786
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

02:05:38.206 --> 02:05:39.666
You're clear!

02:05:47.596 --> 02:05:50.346
Just keep going north. Get us deep in the mountains.

02:05:50.426 --> 02:05:51.846
Copy that.

02:05:58.816 --> 02:06:02.106
- Norm, you all good up there? - Yep! Still here.

02:06:03.986 --> 02:06:08.656
Well, at least they can't track us up here. Not this far into the Vortex.

02:06:08.736 --> 02:06:10.786
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

02:06:10.866 --> 02:06:12.366
Yeah.

02:06:12.446 --> 02:06:14.406
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

02:06:23.256 --> 02:06:24.416
Ouch.

02:06:27.796 --> 02:06:29.256
You big baby.

02:06:30.596 --> 02:06:32.056
We're moving.

02:06:32.596 --> 02:06:34.636
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

02:06:35.596 --> 02:06:37.766
I'm a scientist, remember?

02:06:38.686 --> 02:06:41.146
I don't believe in fairy tales.

02:06:41.976 --> 02:06:43.896
The People can help you.

02:06:44.356 --> 02:06:45.646
I know it.

02:06:47.656 --> 02:06:49.526
Why would they help us?

02:07:05.546 --> 02:07:08.676
The People say Eywa will provide.

02:07:10.596 --> 02:07:13.306
With no home, no hope,

02:07:14.346 --> 02:07:16.516
there was only one place they could go.

02:07:30.946 --> 02:07:32.156
Link's running.

02:07:32.866 --> 02:07:35.866
- What's the plan here, Jake? - There's no plan.

02:07:36.906 --> 02:07:41.576
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now. He's not gonna let you near that place.

02:07:42.536 --> 02:07:43.956
I gotta try.

02:07:46.716 --> 02:07:48.046
Launching.

02:08:09.526 --> 02:08:10.736
Outcast.

02:08:11.526 --> 02:08:12.776
Betrayer.

02:08:13.866 --> 02:08:15.026
Alien.

02:08:16.576 --> 02:08:19.286
I was in the place the eye does not see.

02:08:30.466 --> 02:08:34.346
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

02:08:35.256 --> 02:08:37.306
But to ever face them again,

02:08:37.306 --> 02:08:39.806
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.

02:08:48.356 --> 02:08:51.696
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.

02:08:54.446 --> 02:08:56.826
There's something we gotta do.

02:08:56.906 --> 02:08:58.616
You're not gonna like it.

02:09:08.626 --> 02:09:12.506
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

02:09:12.506 --> 02:09:14.176
Nothing attacks him.

02:09:14.676 --> 02:09:16.006
Easy, boy.

02:09:16.466 --> 02:09:18.306
So why would he ever look up?

02:09:19.426 --> 02:09:21.056
But that was just a theory.

02:10:31.756 --> 02:10:33.376
Toruk Macto?

02:11:13.166 --> 02:11:14.666
I See you.

02:11:17.756 --> 02:11:19.086
I See you.

02:11:27.386 --> 02:11:29.096
I was afraid, Jake.

02:11:30.516 --> 02:11:32.016
For my people.

02:11:35.066 --> 02:11:36.686
I'm not anymore.

02:11:46.116 --> 02:11:48.456
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

02:11:49.076 --> 02:11:51.126
...I stand before you...

02:11:52.126 --> 02:11:55.296
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

02:11:57.876 --> 02:12:02.136
You are Olo'eyktan, and you are a great warrior.

02:12:03.306 --> 02:12:05.466
I can't do this without you.

02:12:12.516 --> 02:12:13.936
Toruk Macto,

02:12:21.776 --> 02:12:23.526
I will fly with you.

02:12:26.826 --> 02:12:28.576
My friend is dying.

02:12:30.956 --> 02:12:32.496
Grace is dying.

02:12:34.496 --> 02:12:36.336
I beg the help of Eywa.

02:12:48.266 --> 02:12:50.266
Look where we are, Grace.

02:12:56.976 --> 02:12:59.356
I need to take some samples.

02:13:22.796 --> 02:13:26.886
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is

02:13:28.096 --> 02:13:29.556
in this body.

02:13:32.096 --> 02:13:33.766
Is that possible?

02:13:33.846 --> 02:13:38.356
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.

02:13:39.606 --> 02:13:41.146
But, Jakesully,

02:13:42.146 --> 02:13:43.776
she is very weak.

02:13:45.236 --> 02:13:48.076
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

02:13:51.246 --> 02:13:53.866
Hear us please, All Mother.

02:13:54.416 --> 02:13:56.746
Eywa, help her.

02:13:57.416 --> 02:13:59.626
Take this spirit into you...

02:14:03.166 --> 02:14:05.426
...and breathe her back to us.

02:14:09.216 --> 02:14:10.886
Let her walk among us...

02:14:13.386 --> 02:14:15.346
...as one of The People.

02:14:44.296 --> 02:14:45.376
Jake.

02:14:47.796 --> 02:14:48.966
Grace.

02:14:51.096 --> 02:14:52.806
I'm with her, Jake.

02:14:54.806 --> 02:14:56.186
She's real!

02:14:59.226 --> 02:15:02.396
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

02:15:03.566 --> 02:15:05.186
What's happening?

02:15:06.146 --> 02:15:07.816
What's happening?

02:15:12.156 --> 02:15:13.326
Grace!

02:15:14.036 --> 02:15:15.196
Grace!

02:15:17.286 --> 02:15:18.916
What's happening?

02:15:25.166 --> 02:15:26.586
Did it work?

02:15:32.256 --> 02:15:36.346
Her wounds were too great. It was not enough time.

02:15:38.016 --> 02:15:39.766
She is with Eywa now.

02:16:13.556 --> 02:16:16.216
With your permission, I will speak now.

02:16:18.596 --> 02:16:21.056
You would honor me by translating.

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:30.356
The Sky People have sent us a message

02:16:33.736 --> 02:16:36.156
that they can take whatever they want

02:16:37.946 --> 02:16:39.746
and no one can stop them.

02:16:43.326 --> 02:16:45.126
Well, we will send them a message.

02:16:47.756 --> 02:16:50.086
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.

02:16:53.386 --> 02:16:55.756
You tell the other clans to come.

02:16:58.886 --> 02:17:01.386
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

02:17:03.606 --> 02:17:06.396
And you fly now with me!

02:17:07.436 --> 02:17:09.936
My brothers! Sisters!

02:17:11.026 --> 02:17:13.106
And we will show the Sky People

02:17:14.116 --> 02:17:15.986
that they cannot take whatever they want,

02:17:17.486 --> 02:17:18.946
and that this,

02:17:19.656 --> 02:17:20.696
this is our land!

02:17:27.796 --> 02:17:29.246
Yah!

02:17:44.346 --> 02:17:45.766
Yah!

02:18:15.176 --> 02:18:16.546
Yah!

02:18:34.066 --> 02:18:35.566
We rode out to the four winds.

02:18:38.316 --> 02:18:40.736
To the horse clans of the plain.

02:18:43.706 --> 02:18:44.746
Back to the stars!

02:18:44.826 --> 02:18:47.076
To the ikran people ofthe Eastern Sea.

02:18:47.076 --> 02:18:48.376
For our children's children!

02:18:48.456 --> 02:18:51.036
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

02:18:54.876 --> 02:18:56.256
Yah!

02:19:32.416 --> 02:19:34.916
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

02:19:35.006 --> 02:19:36.836
is fighting for survival.

02:19:36.916 --> 02:19:38.426
That's a fact!

02:19:39.256 --> 02:19:43.006
There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack.

02:19:44.096 --> 02:19:47.976
Now, these orbital images tell me

02:19:48.386 --> 02:19:51.646
that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred

02:19:51.646 --> 02:19:54.226
to well over 2,000 in one day.

02:19:54.776 --> 02:19:56.776
And more are pouring in.

02:19:59.236 --> 02:20:02.656
In a week's time, there could be 20,000 of them.

02:20:02.736 --> 02:20:05.116
At that point, they will overrun our perimeter.

02:20:05.116 --> 02:20:07.366
Well, that's not gonna happen!

02:20:08.956 --> 02:20:12.626
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.

02:20:12.626 --> 02:20:15.046
We will fight terror with terror.

02:20:19.336 --> 02:20:23.506
Now, the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs

02:20:23.596 --> 02:20:26.006
is protected by their...

02:20:26.016 --> 02:20:27.426
Their deity.

02:20:28.726 --> 02:20:30.846
And when we destroy it,

02:20:30.846 --> 02:20:33.226
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep

02:20:33.306 --> 02:20:36.816
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

02:20:36.896 --> 02:20:39.606
And that, too, is a fact.

02:20:40.316 --> 02:20:42.066
Yeah! Yeah.

02:20:52.536 --> 02:20:56.496
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

02:20:56.586 --> 02:20:58.836
They've got these huge pallets of mine explosives.

02:20:58.916 --> 02:21:01.836
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.

02:21:01.926 --> 02:21:03.836
Fricking daisy cutters!

02:21:05.346 --> 02:21:08.176
Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

02:21:08.266 --> 02:21:10.346
- When? - 0600 tomorrow.

02:21:10.436 --> 02:21:12.306
- Max! Max! - I gotta go.

02:21:14.186 --> 02:21:15.686
We're screwed!

02:21:17.146 --> 02:21:19.396
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan

02:21:19.396 --> 02:21:21.646
that didn't involve martyrdom.

02:21:23.106 --> 02:21:26.486
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

02:21:29.496 --> 02:21:31.536
I have 15 clans out there.

02:21:32.206 --> 02:21:34.326
That's over 2,000 warriors.

02:21:35.836 --> 02:21:40.296
Now, we know these mountains. We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

02:21:41.336 --> 02:21:45.386
Their instruments won't work up here. Missile tracking won't work.

02:21:45.886 --> 02:21:47.386
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

02:21:47.466 --> 02:21:51.726
If they bring the fight to us, then we have the home-field advantage.

02:21:53.596 --> 02:21:57.056
You know he's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

02:21:57.146 --> 02:21:58.396
Yeah, I know.

02:21:58.396 --> 02:22:00.936
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

02:22:01.026 --> 02:22:04.236
That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors.

02:22:05.026 --> 02:22:07.066
It'll destroy them.

02:22:07.066 --> 02:22:09.526
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

02:22:24.586 --> 02:22:27.586
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.

02:22:30.006 --> 02:22:34.766
But if you're there, I need to give you a heads-up.

02:22:37.306 --> 02:22:41.726
If Grace is with you, look into her memories.

02:22:42.986 --> 02:22:45.106
See the world we come from.

02:22:46.196 --> 02:22:48.106
There's no green there.

02:22:49.486 --> 02:22:51.486
They killed their Mother.

02:22:52.286 --> 02:22:54.786
And they're gonna do the same here.

02:22:56.416 --> 02:22:58.996
More Sky People are gonna come.

02:22:59.086 --> 02:23:02.126
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.

02:23:03.416 --> 02:23:05.166
Unless we stop them.

02:23:07.756 --> 02:23:10.846
Look, you chose me for something.

02:23:12.306 --> 02:23:14.176
I will stand and fight.

02:23:15.226 --> 02:23:16.806
You know I will.

02:23:19.306 --> 02:23:21.566
But I need a little help here.

02:23:27.696 --> 02:23:30.736
Our Great Mother does not take sides, Jake.

02:23:32.536 --> 02:23:35.996
She protects only the balance of life.

02:23:47.796 --> 02:23:49.506
It was worth a try.

02:24:20.206 --> 02:24:22.246
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

02:24:22.246 --> 02:24:25.626
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about, man!

02:24:37.726 --> 02:24:41.096
This is Group Leader. We are entering the Flux Vortex.

02:24:41.476 --> 02:24:45.066
- Switch to manual flight mode. - Copy. Manual flight mode.

02:25:19.976 --> 02:25:21.846
This is Papa Dragon.

02:25:21.936 --> 02:25:25.016
I want this mission high and tight. I want to be home for dinner.

02:25:32.526 --> 02:25:36.276
- Suit Team, go. - All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

02:25:46.836 --> 02:25:48.456
Move, move, move!

02:25:54.086 --> 02:25:55.886
Bravo 1-1, move left.

02:25:56.426 --> 02:25:59.846
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

02:26:02.176 --> 02:26:05.806
- Watch formation. Keep moving. - Roger that.

02:26:05.806 --> 02:26:08.226
Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.

02:26:08.316 --> 02:26:09.686
Copy that. Over.

02:26:09.686 --> 02:26:14.396
Eyes up. Check that overhead. And watch those thermal scans.

02:26:14.986 --> 02:26:18.366
All call signs, Papa has lead, pushing to target.

02:26:18.366 --> 02:26:20.826
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

02:26:25.916 --> 02:26:28.456
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

02:26:29.416 --> 02:26:32.046
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

02:26:32.166 --> 02:26:35.086
Make no mistake, people, they're out there.

02:26:36.676 --> 02:26:39.926
All right, people, target in sight. Range, four klicks.

02:26:40.006 --> 02:26:42.216
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

02:26:42.346 --> 02:26:44.846
- Copy. Prepare to offload. - Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

02:26:45.636 --> 02:26:47.846
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

02:26:50.106 --> 02:26:51.186
Hold!

02:26:59.196 --> 02:27:01.236
Charlie 2-1, got big movement.

02:27:01.326 --> 02:27:02.736
- Hold position. - Hold up, hold up.

02:27:02.826 --> 02:27:06.996
- We got movement out there, 500 meters. - Charlie 2-1, hold position.

02:27:13.086 --> 02:27:16.086
Sir, ground has movement! Fast approaching.

02:27:16.086 --> 02:27:18.676
- Charlie Oscar, Rider section. - Firing line!

02:27:19.046 --> 02:27:21.756
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

02:27:22.466 --> 02:27:25.226
- Can't you clean it up? - No, sir. It's the Flux.

02:27:53.496 --> 02:27:56.166
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole. You follow me through.

02:28:37.916 --> 02:28:40.676
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

02:28:41.796 --> 02:28:43.006
Break right. Come around.

02:28:46.556 --> 02:28:48.056
Light them up!

02:28:55.686 --> 02:28:57.896
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

02:29:05.156 --> 02:29:07.036
Yeah! Get some!

02:29:46.026 --> 02:29:47.866
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

02:29:58.706 --> 02:30:00.506
Jake! Jake! You copy?

02:30:01.166 --> 02:30:03.876
We're falling back! We're getting hammered!

02:30:03.876 --> 02:30:04.876
Copy. Get out of there.

02:30:10.056 --> 02:30:11.466
That's him. Get after him!

02:30:28.406 --> 02:30:29.906
Take him out!

02:30:38.206 --> 02:30:39.666
Light her up!

02:30:48.676 --> 02:30:50.096
Right there!

02:30:50.216 --> 02:30:52.466
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

02:30:52.726 --> 02:30:54.426
- Keep her in your sights. - Purging. Feeding the leak.

02:30:54.436 --> 02:30:55.516
Arming all pods.

02:31:01.226 --> 02:31:02.316
That's it!

02:31:32.966 --> 02:31:34.096
Seyzey!

02:32:38.036 --> 02:32:40.206
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

02:32:41.166 --> 02:32:42.576
Sorry, Jake.

02:32:59.596 --> 02:33:00.686
Fire.

02:33:18.786 --> 02:33:21.286
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

02:33:24.126 --> 02:33:25.786
Rogue One, you copy?

02:33:27.796 --> 02:33:28.956
Trudy!

02:33:39.846 --> 02:33:41.136
Time to target, two minutes.

02:33:41.476 --> 02:33:43.896
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

02:33:43.976 --> 02:33:46.146
Copy, Dragon. We are starting our bomb run.

02:33:51.986 --> 02:33:55.816
- Arm number one! - Number one armed!

02:33:57.196 --> 02:33:58.446
Ma Jake!

02:34:00.366 --> 02:34:01.536
I read you.

02:34:10.666 --> 02:34:12.666
- Neytiri! - Seyzey's dead.

02:34:13.256 --> 02:34:15.756
They are very close. They are many.

02:34:17.176 --> 02:34:18.676
Do not attack.

02:34:19.256 --> 02:34:21.216
Do you read me, Neytiri?

02:34:23.806 --> 02:34:25.096
Do not attack!

02:34:25.436 --> 02:34:28.606
Fall back now. Get out of there! That's an order!

02:34:36.696 --> 02:34:37.906
Neytiri!

02:34:39.986 --> 02:34:41.906
I got movement, I got movement.

02:34:41.996 --> 02:34:44.246
Hold position. Something's coming.

02:34:44.326 --> 02:34:46.116
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating. Turn screens over.

02:34:46.206 --> 02:34:48.416
- We got movement 200 meters. - Hold your formation.

02:34:48.416 --> 02:34:50.166
- Be ready. - Watch your flanks.

02:34:55.296 --> 02:34:56.796
Hundred meters and closing fast.

02:35:13.356 --> 02:35:14.936
We gotta get out of here!

02:35:22.736 --> 02:35:24.446
- Fall back! Fall back! - Move! Move! Move!

02:35:24.536 --> 02:35:26.956
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

02:35:34.086 --> 02:35:36.756
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

02:35:43.676 --> 02:35:45.466
Eywa has heard you!

02:35:56.026 --> 02:35:57.446
Come on!

02:36:09.706 --> 02:36:11.576
Fall back! Move! Move!

02:36:36.066 --> 02:36:38.776
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

02:36:38.776 --> 02:36:42.906
Let's get this done. Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

02:36:42.986 --> 02:36:45.906
- Press to target. - Copy. Pressing to target.

02:36:45.906 --> 02:36:47.946
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

02:37:07.766 --> 02:37:10.266
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

02:37:10.266 --> 02:37:12.596
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

02:37:12.596 --> 02:37:13.016
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

02:37:46.756 --> 02:37:47.926
Brace!

02:38:04.946 --> 02:38:06.316
It's Sully.

02:38:20.006 --> 02:38:22.296
- Mask on! - Breach alarm!

02:41:06.666 --> 02:41:08.546
Come on. Come to papa.

02:41:35.986 --> 02:41:37.786
Give it up, Quaritch!

02:41:40.826 --> 02:41:42.326
It's all over.

02:41:43.576 --> 02:41:46.126
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

02:41:46.126 --> 02:41:48.416
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

02:42:44.556 --> 02:42:45.806
Come on!

02:43:01.656 --> 02:43:05.786
Hey, Sully, how's it feel to betray your own race?

02:43:10.416 --> 02:43:12.626
You think you're one of them?

02:43:13.836 --> 02:43:15.506
Time to wake up.

02:44:59.696 --> 02:45:00.776
Jake?

02:45:14.456 --> 02:45:15.586
Jake.

02:45:33.556 --> 02:45:34.976
Jake.

02:45:50.996 --> 02:45:52.996
Jake! Ma Jake!

02:46:34.666 --> 02:46:35.996
I See you.

02:46:41.586 --> 02:46:42.916
I See you.

02:47:08.026 --> 02:47:09.236
I See you, Brother.

02:47:10.446 --> 02:47:11.656
Are The People safe?

02:47:14.496 --> 02:47:15.616
They're safe.

02:47:22.126 --> 02:47:23.626
I can't...

02:47:24.796 --> 02:47:27.046
I cannot lead The People.

02:47:27.586 --> 02:47:29.926
You must lead them... Jakesully.

02:47:31.306 --> 02:47:33.216
I'm not officer material.

02:47:33.306 --> 02:47:35.056
It is decided.

02:47:38.396 --> 02:47:39.596
Now...

02:47:40.816 --> 02:47:43.226
...do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

02:47:47.816 --> 02:47:49.486
I will not kill you.

02:47:49.526 --> 02:47:51.156
It is the way!

02:47:53.486 --> 02:47:55.076
And it is good.

02:47:57.326 --> 02:47:59.166
I will be remembered.

02:48:01.786 --> 02:48:05.836
I fought... with Toruk Macto!

02:48:08.336 --> 02:48:10.216
And we were brothers.

02:48:11.636 --> 02:48:15.716
And he... was my last shadow.

02:49:02.146 --> 02:49:04.976
The aliens went back to their dying world.

02:49:07.146 --> 02:49:10.066
Only a few were chosen to stay.

02:49:22.286 --> 02:49:24.826
The time of great sorrow was ending.

02:49:26.876 --> 02:49:29.296
Toruk Macto was no longerneeded.

02:49:41.846 --> 02:49:45.726
Well, I guess this is my last video log.

02:49:47.566 --> 02:49:51.396
'Cause whatever happens tonight, either way, I'm...

02:49:52.406 --> 02:49:55.236
I'm not gonna be coming back to this place.

02:49:58.866 --> 02:50:00.996
Well, I guess I'd better go.

02:50:03.576 --> 02:50:06.626
Yeah, I don't want to be late for my own party.

02:50:09.956 --> 02:50:12.416
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

02:50:14.926 --> 02:50:17.256
This is Jake Sully signing off.

02:51:49.216 --> 02:51:52.436
Walking through a dream

02:51:52.436 --> 02:51:55.966
I see you

02:51:55.966 --> 02:52:02.516
My light in darkness breathing hope of new life

02:52:02.516 --> 02:52:06.856
Now I live through you and you through me

02:52:06.856 --> 02:52:10.076
Enchanting

02:52:10.076 --> 02:52:17.886
I pray in my heart that this dream never end

02:52:18.146 --> 02:52:26.776
I see me through your eyes

02:52:26.776 --> 02:52:35.066
Living through life flying high

02:52:35.066 --> 02:52:41.936
Your life shines the way into paradise

02:52:42.076 --> 02:52:45.776
So I offer my life

02:52:45.776 --> 02:52:51.126
I offer my love, for you

02:52:51.466 --> 02:52:54.616
When my heart was never open

02:52:54.616 --> 02:52:57.756
And my spirit never free

02:52:57.756 --> 02:53:04.936
To the world that you have shown me

02:53:04.936 --> 02:53:09.976
But my eyes could not division

02:53:09.976 --> 02:53:18.846
All the colours of love and of life ever more

02:53:18.846 --> 02:53:26.686
Evermore(I see me through your eyes)

02:53:26.686 --> 02:53:33.166
I see me through your eyes(Living through life flying high)

02:53:33.166 --> 02:53:36.756
Flying high

02:53:36.756 --> 02:53:43.596
Your love shines the way into paradise
