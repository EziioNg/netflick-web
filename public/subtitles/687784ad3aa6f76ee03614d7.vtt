00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.387
The heat wave continues.
It's 109 degrees in Los Ángeles.

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.978
As drought-ridden Los Ángeles
swelters in agonising heat...

00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.397
...drug lords wage warfare in the streets.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.276
Yet another open conflict...
Oh, fuck this! Get me out of here!

00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:11.082
We're in a war zone, Dave: Two motorcycle
officers horribly wounded in a crossfire...

00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:16.087
...the police seemingly unable to rescue them
in spite of several desperate, heroic attempts.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.173
It's completely out of control down here.

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:29.392
My beautiful cantina,
everything I own, they shot it to pieces.

00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:32.895
My microwave,
my automatic steamer, my grill...

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.106
You fucking pendejos!

00:03:09.557 --> 00:03:10.725
Fuck you!

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:17.398
Tony Pope, live with Hard Core,
on the scene andin yourface.

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:19.192
It's like Dante's hell.

00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:21.444
Smoke, fire, oppressive heat...

00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:27.408
...as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends
again transform LA into a slaughterhouse.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.329
Who the hell's in charge down here?
The cops?

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:34.374
They're outmanned,
outgunned and incompetent.

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:37.418
Mr Mayor,
on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe...

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:40.838
...get off your butt,
get down here and declare martial law!

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:09.534
OK, don't keep me in suspense, Danny boy!

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:11.911
It has not been a nice day!

00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:16.749
Two motors pulled over a truck, stumbled
right in the middle of a narc stakeout.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:21.045
You know, ten Colombians
and Scorpios armed to fuck all.

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:23.548
They're trying to get in their headquarters.

00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:27.510
We're keeping them pinned down,
but those officers are bleeding to death.

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:30.388
Fuck! They're dying, man.

00:04:31.764 --> 00:04:33.808
Where the hell is Special Weapons?

00:04:33.891 --> 00:04:37.812
They're still tied up in that shootout
in San Pedro with the Jamaicans.

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:39.564
They shot down a chopper.

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:43.985
Mills and Johnson won't last much longer.
We need an assault vehicle to go get 'em.

00:04:44.068 --> 00:04:46.237
I'm gonna chat with these assholes.

00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:49.490
- When I give the signal, give me some cover!
- Got it!

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:08.885
Too small.

00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:10.678
Right.

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:47.799
Come on! Come on!

00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:50.718
Get 'em out of here! Now!

00:05:58.017 --> 00:05:59.519
Vámonos!

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.563
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.875
- Vámonos!
- Vámonos!

00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:47.400
Hey, assholes!

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:09.714
Mike, are you OK?

00:07:09.923 --> 00:07:13.509
- Yeah. Let's get the rest.
- We can't. Orders from Chief Heinemann.

00:07:13.593 --> 00:07:16.054
He says surround building and wait.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:18.056
- Wait for what?
- I don't know!

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:21.601
Some bullshit special unit. The feds, the DEA.

00:07:21.684 --> 00:07:25.229
If we let those bastards get dug in now,
we'll have to level the building!

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:27.982
- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mi.

00:07:28.017 --> 00:07:29.776
- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mi.

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:31.402
Vámonos! Vámonos!

00:07:31.486 --> 00:07:33.363
Venga! Aprisa!

00:07:33.488 --> 00:07:35.365
Venga!

00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:38.576
Chingale! Chingale!

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:49.337
Come and get it. El Scorpio is ready.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.686
- Sarge, any of your people in the building?
- No.

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:06.271
Let's go.

00:08:06.354 --> 00:08:09.357
Lieutenant, can't let you in.
Heinemann's on his way.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.943
Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass! Come on!

00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:15.029
Goddamn it. Go with him.

00:08:40.471 --> 00:08:42.932
Three, two, one...

00:08:43.016 --> 00:08:44.684
Go!

00:08:51.983 --> 00:08:55.111
Get back, back, back. Back.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.866
Next door over.

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:18.760
Take this room!

00:09:23.056 --> 00:09:25.350
First floor, officer down. We need backup.

00:09:44.994 --> 00:09:46.829
Freeze!

00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:48.623
I said hold it!

00:09:48.706 --> 00:09:52.877
Now, lay your guns down.
You can walk down or fly, it's your choice.

00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:55.630
I said put it down, asshole!

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:00.802
No!

00:10:23.074 --> 00:10:25.410
Let's do it now!

00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:28.204
Take it easy.

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:34.210
Damn, it's hot.

00:11:00.236 --> 00:11:02.071
Must be losing it.

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.825
Mike!

00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:08.494
Spread out. Secure the roof.

00:11:08.578 --> 00:11:11.581
Just take it easy. I'm right here.

00:11:12.498 --> 00:11:14.834
All clear. All clear on the site.

00:11:15.084 --> 00:11:17.253
Oh, Dannyboy.

00:11:18.004 --> 00:11:19.839
I gotta get down from here.

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:24.427
Shit.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.598
OK, search the roof.
Check every floor. Maybe someone else...

00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:31.267
Seal it off. No one leaves.

00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:33.895
Danny, get me off this damn roof.

00:11:36.147 --> 00:11:39.317
- You get the rest of them?
- Somebody beat us to it.

00:11:51.287 --> 00:11:52.914
Leona.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.972
Oh, shit.

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:34.205
- What happened to El Scorpio?
- He's out front having lunch.

00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:36.291
What the hell is this?

00:12:36.374 --> 00:12:38.042
I don't know.

00:12:38.126 --> 00:12:40.086
They've been cut to pieces.

00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:44.382
- Must be the Jamaicans.
- Their style, but where the hell did they go?

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:48.970
OK, nobody gets in here
until Forensic arrives. Nobody.

00:12:49.053 --> 00:12:50.638
OK, you know the drill.

00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:20.752
Mike.

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.588
Up there.

00:13:29.636 --> 00:13:34.390
He must have been killed out here,
and then someone...

00:13:36.017 --> 00:13:40.647
That's about 35, 40 feet. No rope, no ladder.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.275
The guy weighs about 190, 195 pounds.

00:13:44.359 --> 00:13:46.235
You couldn't carry him up there.

00:13:47.612 --> 00:13:49.405
Lieutenant?

00:13:49.489 --> 00:13:53.576
Deputy Chief Heinemann's downstairs.
He wants you out of the building now.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.662
Ah, son of a bitch.

00:13:56.746 --> 00:13:58.957
What the fuck is going on?

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.960
This is not good, Mike.
Not good at all.

00:14:06.214 --> 00:14:09.425
- I want a real name on this joker, OK?
- You got it.

00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:11.177
Mike.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.516
Phil, this is quite a surprise.
What brings you down from the palace?

00:14:16.975 --> 00:14:20.687
You let me down, Mike.
You're making me look bad.

00:14:21.562 --> 00:14:23.982
I thought we had an understanding.

00:14:24.065 --> 00:14:26.442
I put my ass on the line to get you here...

00:14:26.526 --> 00:14:29.237
...and all I expect is a little cooperation!

00:14:31.322 --> 00:14:33.533
You were told this was a federal matter.

00:14:33.616 --> 00:14:36.286
Yet you disobeyed an order
to stay out of the building.

00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:39.706
Don't let this get out, Phil,
but it's a fucking war down here.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.126
Soldiers take orders. Don't push it!

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:46.963
I'll push it as far as I can, Phil,
cos we're fighting for ourlives here...

00:14:47.046 --> 00:14:50.717
...while you're downtown
pushing pencils and kissing ass!

00:14:53.386 --> 00:14:56.222
I don't roll over for anybody,
especially the feds...

00:14:56.306 --> 00:14:58.600
...without a goddamn good explanation!

00:15:22.081 --> 00:15:25.752
Take this equipment up to the third floor.
Come on, let's move!

00:15:37.764 --> 00:15:39.891
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir!

00:15:39.974 --> 00:15:42.602
What the hell is going on here, Heinemann?

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:47.273
Insubordination. Disregard for direct orders
from a supervising officer.

00:15:47.357 --> 00:15:49.734
Now get back to your cage at Alvarado.

00:15:49.817 --> 00:15:53.571
- I'll show you insubordination, you son of...
- No, no, no!

00:15:53.655 --> 00:15:55.490
Where you running to? Come here!

00:15:55.573 --> 00:15:58.409
You don't need this, Mike. It's not worth it.

00:15:58.493 --> 00:16:00.286
Relax.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.163
Oh, fuck!

00:16:22.183 --> 00:16:24.018
I have an update for you.

00:16:24.102 --> 00:16:27.480
In a shootout, five members
ofone Colombian drug gang...

00:16:27.563 --> 00:16:31.818
...were ambushe dby their bloody rivals,
the Jamaican Voodoo Posse...

00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:36.281
...who escaped withouta trace - ha! -
again making total fools of...

00:16:36.364 --> 00:16:39.117
- A detective is here to see you.
- Back there.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.663
Listen, lady, you got a backed-up toilet.
Call a plumber, not the cops.

00:16:43.746 --> 00:16:48.751
- This licence has expired.
- Bullshit! I paid that fee six months ago.

00:16:48.835 --> 00:16:51.713
- I'll kick your ass!
- Sit down! Right now!

00:16:51.796 --> 00:16:55.091
- Move! Get your ass movin'!
- Just calm the fuck down!

00:16:57.885 --> 00:16:59.887
What you lookin' at?

00:17:01.848 --> 00:17:03.683
And all you got to do...

00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:06.769
...is tee it high and let it fly.

00:17:07.437 --> 00:17:10.315
Ow! Dead solid perfect.

00:17:10.398 --> 00:17:15.194
Now, remember, for distance
you gotta gently but firmly grip the club.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.740
Lieutenant Harrigan!
Detective Lambert, Rampart Division.

00:17:18.823 --> 00:17:21.868
Hey, kid, just have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

00:17:22.243 --> 00:17:24.120
- Hey, Cap.
- Don't start, Mike.

00:17:24.203 --> 00:17:28.166
Heinemann's already been up my ass so far
I won't be able to sit down for a week.

00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:30.084
We're not winning this war.

00:17:30.168 --> 00:17:33.129
As much as it'll piss you off,
you'll have to play the game.

00:17:33.504 --> 00:17:38.384
"Effective immediately, a federal task force
under Special Agent Peter Keyes...

00:17:38.468 --> 00:17:45.224
...will investigate criminal activities involving
the trafficking of controlled substances."

00:17:45.308 --> 00:17:48.478
And you willextend him
your full cooperation.

00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:51.606
So you're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

00:17:51.689 --> 00:17:54.859
The feds are calling the shots on this.
My hands are tied!

00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:58.863
- Yeah?
- Captain Pilgrim, Peter Keyes.

00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:02.325
- It's good to meet you.
- And you, sir.

00:18:02.408 --> 00:18:05.954
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.
Special Agent Peter Keyes, DEA.

00:18:06.371 --> 00:18:08.790
Heard a lot about you.

00:18:08.873 --> 00:18:12.126
I'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.213
Don't mean to be stepping on your toes.

00:18:15.296 --> 00:18:20.510
But we want to prevent King Willie's voodoo
gangs from taking over the entire West Coast.

00:18:22.387 --> 00:18:24.514
I wish I could tell you more.

00:18:24.597 --> 00:18:28.184
But we have a large number
of deep-cover operatives involved.

00:18:28.685 --> 00:18:32.438
You know how it is. We all have a job to do.

00:18:32.939 --> 00:18:37.819
Now, I'm sure we can respect
each other's situation and act responsibly.

00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:40.238
Well...

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:42.532
...um, cooperation...

00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:45.994
...is my middle name.

00:18:52.584 --> 00:18:54.669
I'll see you around.

00:19:01.342 --> 00:19:05.888
- I'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like I said, have a seat. I'll be right with you.

00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:08.641
- Who is this dude?
- Yeah, what an asshole.

00:19:11.352 --> 00:19:13.313
All right, Danny boy, what we got?

00:19:13.396 --> 00:19:17.317
What have we got? Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.320
The next minute... they're all shish kebab.

00:19:20.403 --> 00:19:22.113
Not one bullet wound.

00:19:22.196 --> 00:19:24.866
It wasn't drugs or money.
There's a shitload of that.

00:19:24.949 --> 00:19:29.329
Maybe King Willie brought in some
outside talent. He's making his big move.

00:19:29.412 --> 00:19:31.706
A pro would have split
the moment he heard us.

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:33.958
More than one, we would have seen them.

00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:37.295
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute...

00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:41.549
...and then took out four men
armed with machine guns by hand!

00:19:41.633 --> 00:19:43.927
And then got by us.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.305
Maybe we should give him ajob.
Let's put him on the payroll.

00:19:47.722 --> 00:19:51.351
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs,
somebody is screaming bloody murder...

00:19:51.434 --> 00:19:53.937
- You gotta... You gotta hear this.
- What?!

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.522
Hey. Hey, I forgot to tell you.

00:19:56.606 --> 00:19:58.316
See that guy there?

00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:00.401
That's Ferris's replacement.

00:20:01.861 --> 00:20:05.782
This guy's Jerry Lambert.
The Lone Ranger from Rampart station.

00:20:05.865 --> 00:20:07.659
That's the Lone Ranger?

00:20:07.742 --> 00:20:10.662
I thought he was here
to fix the air conditioning.

00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:14.040
I said "Lady, you are under arrest."
And she said "Why?"

00:20:14.123 --> 00:20:17.460
I said "Because your husband is dead.
You killed him."

00:20:18.044 --> 00:20:20.588
- Know what she said, didn't miss a beat?
- Uh, no.

00:20:20.672 --> 00:20:25.385
She said "I stabbed that son of a bitch
plenty oftimes. He never died on me before."

00:20:29.013 --> 00:20:33.351
Looks like he's putting the moves to Leona.

00:20:33.434 --> 00:20:35.228
His first big mistake.

00:20:38.898 --> 00:20:40.566
I have heard about you.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.402
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

00:20:42.485 --> 00:20:45.822
- Like your last partner got shot.
- What?

00:20:45.905 --> 00:20:46.990
Well...

00:20:47.073 --> 00:20:50.368
- Oy!
- You try that cowboy shit with me, fucker...

00:20:50.451 --> 00:20:52.745
...you can kiss these goodbye.

00:20:53.413 --> 00:20:55.915
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

00:20:55.999 --> 00:21:00.086
Well, well, I see that
the three of you have met.

00:21:00.962 --> 00:21:04.007
Lambert, if you're feeling up to it...

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.011
...why don't you limp your way in
to the lieutenant. He wants to talk to you.

00:21:08.094 --> 00:21:09.596
Yeah.

00:21:11.973 --> 00:21:14.434
- You're a bad girl.
- Ooh, I like that.

00:21:14.517 --> 00:21:15.685
No, no, no!

00:21:15.935 --> 00:21:19.522
Goddamn, is that bitch on the rag or what?

00:21:23.192 --> 00:21:29.032
This is what I call "the speech", kid.
I only give it once, so pay attention.

00:21:29.115 --> 00:21:34.495
Until now, it's all been fun and games,
cops and robbers, dunking doughnuts.

00:21:35.371 --> 00:21:38.917
But you're in the shit now.
Metro Command is a war zone.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.919
Lieutenant, I've paid my dues.

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:43.463
I had to bust my ass to get my transfer.

00:21:43.546 --> 00:21:45.798
And that scares the shit out of me, kid.

00:21:45.882 --> 00:21:48.551
No one requests to come here
unless they want a reputation.

00:21:48.635 --> 00:21:53.473
There's no room for anyone looking
to prove themselves. I won't stand for it.

00:21:53.556 --> 00:21:58.478
Don't get me wrong. We need good cops,
and they say you're good at what you do.

00:21:58.561 --> 00:22:00.855
But the team comes first.

00:22:00.939 --> 00:22:04.943
You live by that, and you'll be OK.
And we'll all be there for you.

00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:07.737
Remember, the door swings both ways.

00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:10.198
That's it.

00:22:15.787 --> 00:22:17.914
Hey, kid.

00:22:18.498 --> 00:22:20.333
Welcome to the war.

00:22:38.768 --> 00:22:40.770
No!

00:22:47.151 --> 00:22:50.488
OK, guys.
This has gone too far now, huh?

00:22:52.073 --> 00:22:54.075
Hey, hey, guys.

00:22:54.993 --> 00:22:57.620
I- I-I know you're trying to scare me, huh?

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.750
Well, you did a pretty good job, man.

00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:04.836
I'm scared now.

00:23:06.004 --> 00:23:07.672
Stop it now.

00:23:08.006 --> 00:23:09.757
I can pay you.

00:23:09.841 --> 00:23:12.719
$2 million, man. In cash.

00:23:12.802 --> 00:23:15.680
- Right now!
- This is not about money.

00:23:16.347 --> 00:23:19.017
This is about power!

00:23:19.892 --> 00:23:22.103
There's a new king in the streets.

00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:25.565
This is a message he has for your people.

00:23:25.648 --> 00:23:27.650
You are history.

00:23:27.734 --> 00:23:30.653
Fucking history, goddamn puto.

00:23:40.163 --> 00:23:42.749
What the fuck are you doing now, man?

00:23:42.832 --> 00:23:44.834
You're crazy!

00:23:45.209 --> 00:23:47.211
King Willie says...

00:23:48.212 --> 00:23:50.298
...not only do I have to kill you...

00:23:55.094 --> 00:23:58.264
...but I have to take your soul.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.604
Voodoo magic.

00:24:04.687 --> 00:24:07.273
Fucking voodoo magic, man.

00:24:12.153 --> 00:24:14.572
But you know what? I tell you what I believe.

00:24:18.368 --> 00:24:20.370
Shit happens.

00:24:35.593 --> 00:24:37.428
Shoot it!

00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:10.295
Fucker!

00:25:34.068 --> 00:25:36.613
Sh... shit happens.

00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:38.698
Shit happens.

00:25:50.335 --> 00:25:54.255
I'm standing just outside
a penthouse complex in San Pedro...

00:25:54.339 --> 00:25:57.592
...involving as many as 20 people.
It's uncertain who they were.

00:25:57.675 --> 00:26:01.346
One report indicates it might be
the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse.

00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:06.643
I go in for my physical and the doctor says
"I need a semen, stool and urine sample."

00:26:06.726 --> 00:26:10.772
I say "Gee, doc, I'm in a big hurry.
Can I just leave my underwear?"

00:26:10.855 --> 00:26:12.565
Oh, God.

00:26:13.232 --> 00:26:15.109
Achtung, mein Kapitan!

00:26:15.193 --> 00:26:18.821
Word is there may be as many as
50 more dead bodies up there.

00:26:18.905 --> 00:26:20.615
Oh, man, it's Pope.

00:26:20.698 --> 00:26:22.742
That parasite must live in his car.

00:26:22.825 --> 00:26:25.161
I'll handle it. PR's my specialty.

00:26:25.662 --> 00:26:27.997
Word is they want your ass off the job.

00:26:28.081 --> 00:26:29.999
- Tony!
- Who the hell are you?

00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:32.794
Your biggest fan!
Catch your show all the time.

00:26:32.877 --> 00:26:36.089
- I got a job to do!
- Your job is to root for garbage elsewhere.

00:26:36.172 --> 00:26:39.384
- Been inside?
- Yeah. We were gonna go in with our guys...

00:26:39.467 --> 00:26:43.846
...but we were told on a radio transmission
nobody goes in under any circumstances.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:49.269
All units, be advised.
Federal offcers will handle investigation.

00:26:49.352 --> 00:26:52.397
- We didn't hear that. Let's go.
- You're the boss.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.983
This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...

00:26:55.858 --> 00:26:58.444
Hey, nice flashlight. Mind if I borrow it?

00:27:06.953 --> 00:27:08.663
OK.

00:27:18.256 --> 00:27:19.924
Damn!

00:27:22.677 --> 00:27:24.053
Look familiar?

00:27:26.264 --> 00:27:27.807
Fuck.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.184
Oh, God.

00:27:31.436 --> 00:27:33.855
Ramon Vega, the crack king.

00:27:33.938 --> 00:27:36.566
Biggest operator in East LA. 100 keys a week.

00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:41.738
- Why isn't he skinned? And who are they?
- Jamaicans. King Willie's boys.

00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:43.489
That makes no sense.

00:27:43.573 --> 00:27:47.368
This was a voodoo ritual.
I've seen it before. They took his heart out.

00:27:47.452 --> 00:27:49.787
- What for?
- Terror tactics, man.

00:27:49.871 --> 00:27:52.874
You know,
to scare the shit out of their enemies.

00:27:53.499 --> 00:27:56.252
- King Willie.
- Who the hell is King Willie?

00:27:56.336 --> 00:28:00.757
King Willie, voodoo priest of the LA posses.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.010
Ran the terror gangs
for Edward Seaga in Jamaica...

00:28:04.093 --> 00:28:06.095
...till he got too powerful.

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:09.223
The Jamaican chiefs
won't make a move without his approval.

00:28:09.307 --> 00:28:11.267
So what the fuck happened?

00:28:11.351 --> 00:28:13.019
Shit!

00:28:15.104 --> 00:28:17.106
Hey, we got a survivor!

00:28:25.949 --> 00:28:27.951
What's she saying?

00:28:28.493 --> 00:28:31.204
I don't know. She's not making any sense.

00:28:31.287 --> 00:28:35.833
She keeps saying "El diablo vino por ellos."
The devil came for them.

00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:41.422
If it's the Colombians, why'd they leave their
boss hanging and his girl naked on the floor?

00:28:41.506 --> 00:28:44.425
- It wasn't the Colombians.
- Our friend from the armoury.

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:46.636
Right.

00:28:46.719 --> 00:28:48.721
We got a new player in town.

00:28:49.973 --> 00:28:52.308
Come over here, Mike. Check this out.

00:28:56.729 --> 00:28:58.523
What is that?

00:28:58.982 --> 00:29:02.527
Looks like a spear tip or something.

00:29:03.069 --> 00:29:05.154
This is a restricted area.

00:29:05.238 --> 00:29:07.573
I want it cleared immediately.

00:29:07.657 --> 00:29:09.659
You're walking on physical evidence.

00:29:10.577 --> 00:29:12.704
- We'll take care of her.
- She's with me.

00:29:12.787 --> 00:29:16.332
Lieutenant, I'd like
a word with you in private, please.

00:29:21.337 --> 00:29:24.757
They say that persistence
is your most outstanding quality.

00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:27.719
- I know this is your show...
- You're not listening to me!

00:29:27.969 --> 00:29:31.347
You got a big nose and
you're sticking it too far in my business.

00:29:31.431 --> 00:29:34.434
Maybe you can hear this.
The next time you cross me...

00:29:34.517 --> 00:29:37.437
...you're gonna turn up missing.

00:29:38.062 --> 00:29:41.691
- Garber, the man with the camera. Get him.
- Yes, sir.

00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:45.153
- All right. Let's go.
- Stay away.

00:29:45.236 --> 00:29:48.698
- Hey, fuck you, man! Give me my camera!
- Shut the fuck up.

00:29:48.781 --> 00:29:51.826
Hey, wait a minute!
I got my rights! I'm ajournalist.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.954
- Harrigan! Harrigan!
- Shut up. Let's go.

00:29:55.288 --> 00:29:58.625
Smells like a cover-up.
The press has a right to know!

00:29:58.708 --> 00:30:01.210
Take him out of the building. Search him.

00:30:02.754 --> 00:30:05.048
Now you get the hell out of here.

00:30:07.175 --> 00:30:08.843
Who the hell are you, Keyes?

00:30:08.927 --> 00:30:12.388
The last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

00:30:26.611 --> 00:30:28.404
Wanna make me proud, kid?

00:30:28.488 --> 00:30:32.116
Take your bag oftricks, stay with them,
find out where they take her.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.037
Meet me later at La Cita's.
And be careful. These guys are good.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.040
Hey, don't worry!
Surveillance is my specialty.

00:30:39.123 --> 00:30:41.668
OK, then. Just get going.

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.838
Go get 'em, Lone Ranger.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.218
Danny, look here. We gotta take this real cool.

00:30:50.301 --> 00:30:54.180
These guys sure aren't the DEA,
but it's still Keyes's party.

00:30:54.264 --> 00:30:57.934
You stick around, stay out of sight.
I'll meet you at one o'clock.

00:30:58.017 --> 00:31:02.522
We'll take a good look at that room, OK?
Hey, wait for me.

00:31:03.106 --> 00:31:05.733
Dannyboy,
no hero stuff, understand?

00:31:05.817 --> 00:31:07.860
Dan-Dan-Dannyboy.

00:31:11.406 --> 00:31:13.574
Watch your ass, Danny boy.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.917
She never made it.

00:31:23.251 --> 00:31:25.086
The feds were waiting.

00:31:25.503 --> 00:31:27.505
Hustled her off in a chopper.

00:31:28.548 --> 00:31:31.634
- Let me guess. A silver Alouette?
- That very one.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:38.474
And guess what. Your pal Keyes was
running the whole show. And his butt boys.

00:31:38.975 --> 00:31:40.893
Son of a bitch.

00:31:40.977 --> 00:31:42.937
You done real good, kid.

00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:46.357
Now tomorrow, start a tail on Keyes.

00:31:46.441 --> 00:31:48.860
Everything he does, everywhere he goes.

00:31:48.943 --> 00:31:50.945
Who knows? You might just get lucky.

00:31:51.654 --> 00:31:53.114
Lieutenant!

00:31:53.197 --> 00:31:54.741
Luck...

00:31:54.824 --> 00:31:56.826
...is my specialty.

00:31:58.077 --> 00:32:00.288
Yeah. I bet it is.

00:32:06.002 --> 00:32:10.965
Now, if you'll excuse me, Lieutenant,
I got some serious police work to attend to.

00:32:11.424 --> 00:32:13.426
Come to Papa.

00:32:14.427 --> 00:32:15.595
Hey!

00:32:15.678 --> 00:32:18.348
- Hey, are your balls OK?
- Fine.

00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:20.391
How are yours?

00:32:20.475 --> 00:32:22.977
- Hey, do you mind? It's my sister.
- Say what?

00:32:23.061 --> 00:32:24.854
Oh, you're not my sister.

00:32:27.482 --> 00:32:31.819
Son of a bitch.
Who are you really chasing, Keyes?

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.906
Time to go to work.

00:36:03.906 --> 00:36:06.200
- Shit.
- Dannyboy.

00:36:06.826 --> 00:36:08.745
Mike?

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.336
Oh, God!

00:36:18.671 --> 00:36:21.549
No. No. Oh, God!

00:36:24.928 --> 00:36:27.639
Oh, Mother of God!

00:36:28.723 --> 00:36:30.058
Please, no!

00:36:39.317 --> 00:36:42.028
Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan:

00:36:42.111 --> 00:36:45.698
...violence prone,
obsessive/compulsive personality...

00:36:45.782 --> 00:36:48.618
...a history ofexcessive physical force...

00:36:48.701 --> 00:36:53.623
...throughouthis 18 years
as a Los Ángeles police offcer.

00:36:53.706 --> 00:36:59.212
Also responsible for the destruction of
11 patrol cars, a city bus...

00:36:59.295 --> 00:37:01.547
What about ten commendations for valour...

00:37:01.631 --> 00:37:06.219
...and the best felony arrest record
in the history of this department?

00:37:06.302 --> 00:37:11.599
That and my intervention on your behalf
are the only reasons you still have a job.

00:37:11.683 --> 00:37:17.313
If it were up to the chief, he'd charge you with
Detective Archuleta's death and suspend you.

00:37:20.233 --> 00:37:22.277
As it is, he left it in my hands.

00:37:23.444 --> 00:37:28.700
Now, this John Wayne attitude and flagrant
disregard for policy is gonna end now.

00:37:29.242 --> 00:37:33.204
No one under my command will impede
the progress of this federal task force...

00:37:33.288 --> 00:37:35.290
...headed by Agent Keyes.

00:37:35.707 --> 00:37:37.709
No one.

00:37:43.715 --> 00:37:45.758
That's it.

00:37:45.842 --> 00:37:47.844
Dismissed.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:58.187
Mike, you're too close to this.
Stay out of it.

00:37:58.271 --> 00:38:01.441
It's a police matter.
They can't keep the department out of it.

00:38:01.524 --> 00:38:03.818
We'll find Danny's killer.

00:38:03.901 --> 00:38:06.738
Captain, Danny and I came up together.

00:38:06.821 --> 00:38:08.990
15 years on the fucking street!

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.869
Whoever killed him's gonna pay.
I'm gonna finish it.

00:38:22.462 --> 00:38:24.130
Hey!

00:38:25.715 --> 00:38:27.717
Hey, come on. What is this?

00:38:33.681 --> 00:38:35.767
Listen, shithead.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:40.438
I don't give a fuck what you want with
this asshole because now it's personal.

00:38:40.521 --> 00:38:42.148
And he's a dead man.

00:38:42.231 --> 00:38:45.443
What you're dealing with
is over your head. I'm warning you...

00:38:45.526 --> 00:38:48.613
You! You don't know
what you're dealing with.

00:38:48.696 --> 00:38:51.574
And I'm warning you.
Stay the fuck out ofmy way!

00:39:04.254 --> 00:39:06.547
- I'll take care of him.
- No.

00:39:07.465 --> 00:39:09.634
Let him go.

00:39:09.717 --> 00:39:11.928
We're too close.

00:39:16.683 --> 00:39:21.145
... claiming as his, turf controlled
by the Jamaican and Colombian drug lords.

00:39:21.229 --> 00:39:23.815
Watch as we continue our report.

00:39:24.732 --> 00:39:27.527
Yes, the wordis out: LA is up forgrabs...

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.655
...the spoils ofour once fine city
going to the ruthless scum...

00:39:30.738 --> 00:39:34.325
...who can spread the most
carnage and bloodin our streets.

00:39:34.409 --> 00:39:36.494
The latest update on the scoreboard:

00:39:36.578 --> 00:39:39.414
...five assorted trash and one good cop...

00:39:39.497 --> 00:39:41.291
...one of the best on ourforce.

00:39:41.374 --> 00:39:44.460
Who's next? Where's the mayor?
He's not even in the city...

00:39:44.544 --> 00:39:46.546
Forget it. It's over.

00:39:47.422 --> 00:39:51.509
Mike, goddamn it.
This ain't your personal little war, you know.

00:39:51.593 --> 00:39:53.303
I loved Danny, too.

00:39:53.553 --> 00:39:57.265
Hey, you told me the only way
you survive is because you're a team.

00:39:57.348 --> 00:39:59.809
The door swings both ways. Remember?

00:40:05.773 --> 00:40:07.942
All right. We'll do it together.

00:40:09.527 --> 00:40:11.654
Come on. Talk to me about Keyes.

00:40:11.988 --> 00:40:16.200
- We've been on him for the last three days.
- And they're not looking for drug dealers.

00:40:16.284 --> 00:40:19.913
Yeah. They've been setting up
weird radar sensors all over downtown.

00:40:19.996 --> 00:40:22.540
I used my whole repertory
to keep up with them!

00:40:22.999 --> 00:40:26.127
I had scanners on them,
but they scrambled my shit up.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.421
They had equipment I can't begin to touch.

00:40:28.671 --> 00:40:30.673
And then this morning...

00:40:31.341 --> 00:40:33.927
...I lost 'em.
- We lost them.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.095
- Where?
- Vernon and Industry.

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:39.140
- They disappeared!
- The slaughterhouse district?

00:40:39.223 --> 00:40:42.602
Yeah, and in this heat, whoo!
I mean, BO and barbecue!

00:40:42.685 --> 00:40:45.813
Whatever Keyes is looking for,
he's found it, or close to it.

00:40:46.105 --> 00:40:48.191
Leona, I want to meet with King Willie.

00:40:48.274 --> 00:40:50.860
Willie and I seem to have the same problem.

00:40:51.569 --> 00:40:54.822
- In the meantime, you come with me.
- Mike, it's impossible!

00:40:54.906 --> 00:40:56.908
Just do it.

00:40:58.826 --> 00:41:00.745
Fuck!

00:41:02.038 --> 00:41:04.457
Omega 1. This is Control.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.376
This is Omega 1.

00:41:06.751 --> 00:41:10.004
We only have 22 minutes
on safe window of operation.

00:41:10.088 --> 00:41:13.841
- Yes, sir.
- Verify that final telemetry check.

00:41:13.925 --> 00:41:15.718
Start your test now.

00:41:15.802 --> 00:41:18.471
Scan track three, two, one...

00:41:18.554 --> 00:41:19.681
...mark.

00:41:19.764 --> 00:41:22.558
Number six,
power up on the UV banks.

00:41:23.601 --> 00:41:27.647
We're complete
on the lower UV banks. Ready for testing.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.650
Second level,
check for ambient temperature variations.

00:41:30.733 --> 00:41:32.860
You got two minutes. Now get going.

00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:39.617
To all units. All units, you have
approximately 20 minutes to finish your task.

00:41:39.826 --> 00:41:41.911
- Roger.
- Increase this UV.

00:41:41.995 --> 00:41:43.997
Up 42 per cent.

00:41:47.208 --> 00:41:51.045
Your friend died as
the result of an intrusion in the chest cavity...

00:41:51.129 --> 00:41:54.757
...by an edged weapon
that nearly cleaved the heart in two.

00:41:54.841 --> 00:41:56.926
Death was instantaneous.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:01.264
He was boned like a fish.
I've never seen anything like this.

00:42:02.098 --> 00:42:04.100
Please, do not touch anything.

00:42:08.146 --> 00:42:10.982
Doctor, what about the other victims?

00:42:11.482 --> 00:42:12.942
Anything there?

00:42:13.026 --> 00:42:15.987
The federal team
brought in their own forensic examiners.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.741
I am the medical examiner
and the chief pathologist in the city...

00:42:19.824 --> 00:42:21.534
...and they've cut me out.

00:42:21.618 --> 00:42:24.996
Any way you can get a look at evidence
the feds have collected?

00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:29.167
- I mean, they must have run tests.
- It won't be easy.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.336
Doctor...

00:42:31.419 --> 00:42:35.089
...I pried this from Danny's hands.
This is what took him into the rafters.

00:42:35.173 --> 00:42:38.885
- It has almost no weight.
- But it cuts like steel.

00:42:38.968 --> 00:42:40.762
Let me see.

00:42:43.014 --> 00:42:48.061
We are now at 150,000 times
normal magnification.

00:42:53.775 --> 00:42:57.904
Astonishing. This material doesn't
correspond to anything on the periodic table.

00:42:59.364 --> 00:43:03.743
- Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?
- Don't know. It's not from a hardware store.

00:43:03.826 --> 00:43:05.954
- Military?
- Uh, good guess.

00:43:06.037 --> 00:43:08.831
Either something that got away,
or something they want.

00:43:08.915 --> 00:43:12.043
Keyes. Ah, we're getting closer now
to what happened...

00:43:13.336 --> 00:43:15.004
Hey, no!

00:43:15.088 --> 00:43:17.215
Easy, kid. Put your gun away.

00:43:17.298 --> 00:43:19.300
King Willie will see you now.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.639
# I'm tired of the ratrace, I wanna have fun...

00:43:24.722 --> 00:43:26.766
- It's OK.
- Don't you want me with you?

00:43:26.849 --> 00:43:28.685
I'll call you later.

00:43:28.768 --> 00:43:32.438
- You want me to follow you?
- I'll call you later!

00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:35.733
# I can't take my mind off my problems...

00:43:35.817 --> 00:43:37.944
You want some ganja, man?

00:43:39.946 --> 00:43:41.239
License plate number.

00:43:41.322 --> 00:43:42.824
1-8-8...

00:43:42.907 --> 00:43:44.659
No, no. 1-8-8-3...

00:43:44.742 --> 00:43:46.744
Oh, fuck!

00:43:56.004 --> 00:43:58.464
The door swings both ways, myass.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.967
This door swings both ways.

00:44:17.984 --> 00:44:19.986
Thanks for the ride.

00:44:20.987 --> 00:44:22.363
You know...

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.116
...you guys really ought to cut down.

00:45:08.076 --> 00:45:12.247
They say you want to talk to me.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:17.001
They say you offering me favours.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.840
Tell me why, Babylon.

00:45:22.924 --> 00:45:25.218
Mr Policeman.

00:45:25.843 --> 00:45:29.847
- I want some information.
- Information.

00:45:32.517 --> 00:45:35.937
About the one that's doing all the killing?

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:38.064
He killed your people.

00:45:38.147 --> 00:45:40.149
Now mine.

00:45:41.234 --> 00:45:43.027
I think you know who he is.

00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:45.446
I want him.

00:45:47.282 --> 00:45:50.451
I don't know who he is.

00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:54.747
But I know where he is.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.377
- The other side.
- What are you talking about?

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.170
The spirit world, man.

00:46:02.463 --> 00:46:04.299
You see...

00:46:04.382 --> 00:46:06.384
...it's always the same.

00:46:08.219 --> 00:46:11.222
There's no stopping what can't be stopped.

00:46:11.306 --> 00:46:14.058
No killing what can't be killed.

00:46:14.142 --> 00:46:16.269
Hey, make sense, man.

00:46:16.352 --> 00:46:20.231
This thing
that's killing your people and mine...

00:46:20.315 --> 00:46:22.400
...is from the other side.

00:46:22.483 --> 00:46:25.403
I can feel him all around.

00:46:25.486 --> 00:46:28.948
You can't see the eyes of the demon...

00:46:30.116 --> 00:46:32.952
...until him come calling.

00:46:34.245 --> 00:46:36.706
This is dread, man.

00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:38.791
Truly dread.

00:46:46.132 --> 00:46:49.010
Nothing else for you here, policeman.

00:46:49.093 --> 00:46:51.095
Time to go.

00:47:04.359 --> 00:47:06.277
Prepare yourself.

00:48:13.052 --> 00:48:15.888
"His foundation lie in the holy mountain."

00:48:16.264 --> 00:48:17.599
"Selah."

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.110
This is Tony Pope live from LA...

00:49:11.194 --> 00:49:12.487
...the city of fear.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:16.366
The psycho-vigilante killer
continues his daily diet for murder.

00:49:16.449 --> 00:49:18.117
Bodies strung out...

00:49:18.201 --> 00:49:22.121
...bodies with the skins ripped off,
the hearts torn from the cadavers.

00:49:22.205 --> 00:49:24.999
And just recently,
King Willie, the drug lord...

00:49:25.083 --> 00:49:28.503
...the vicious drug lord found
in an alley just around the corner...

00:49:28.586 --> 00:49:32.590
...with his head cut off and his
spinal column torn from the body.

00:49:32.674 --> 00:49:35.468
A fitting demise
to the Prince of Powder.

00:49:39.389 --> 00:49:42.850
First Danny, then King Willie.
And you were right there!

00:49:43.268 --> 00:49:46.312
He's playing with you, Mike.
You've gotta be careful.

00:49:46.562 --> 00:49:49.148
Yeah. We all gotta be careful.
What about Keyes?

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:53.569
- Anything there?
- Definitely something slippery about Keyes.

00:49:53.653 --> 00:49:56.114
Seems there's a Peter J Keyes.

00:49:56.197 --> 00:49:58.866
PhD physical sciences, Cornell.

00:49:59.367 --> 00:50:03.246
Hot out of college
and into the Strategic Defense Institute.

00:50:03.329 --> 00:50:07.458
Then two years later commissioned
as a captain in Air Force Intelligence.

00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:10.253
Mike, this is a dead end.
We're way out of our league!

00:50:10.336 --> 00:50:15.049
Look, I don't care who's involved.
This guy killed Danny and he's going to fall!

00:50:16.301 --> 00:50:19.470
- What about the good doctor?
- I'm here, Lieutenant.

00:50:19.554 --> 00:50:24.100
The federal authorities erased everything
from the computer file except for this:

00:50:24.183 --> 00:50:28.855
...part of a chemical test
on a fragment ofwood from the penthouse.

00:50:28.938 --> 00:50:30.732
And it contained traces...

00:50:30.815 --> 00:50:34.944
...of cattle blood and heavy traces of steroids.

00:50:35.028 --> 00:50:40.867
I believe whoever killed Detective Archuleta
had recently been in a slaughterhouse.

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:43.494
That's where I lost Keyes the first time!

00:50:43.578 --> 00:50:45.538
Yeah. That's where we'll find him.

00:50:45.622 --> 00:50:49.125
Take the metro.
I'll pick you up at Vernon station in an hour.

00:50:49.208 --> 00:50:52.921
Just because you don't see Keyes's boys
doesn't mean they're not around.

00:51:14.108 --> 00:51:16.444
I just want you to stay in the car. OK?

00:51:16.527 --> 00:51:20.573
Your mom and I won't be very long.
You sit still. We'll be back in a few minutes.

00:51:20.657 --> 00:51:22.659
All right?

00:51:23.201 --> 00:51:25.453
- Come on, honey.
- Yes, darling.

00:51:25.536 --> 00:51:27.538
- Which way was it?
- Down here.

00:51:33.211 --> 00:51:35.338
Take that, you scum-sucking dog.

00:51:59.237 --> 00:52:01.239
Want some candy?

00:52:03.449 --> 00:52:05.702
Brian? Brian!

00:52:05.785 --> 00:52:08.580
- You come here right this minute!
- Mommy, I saw a ghost.

00:52:08.663 --> 00:52:11.708
Want some candy?
Want some candy?

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.520
Rest.

00:52:37.734 --> 00:52:39.527
Want some candy?

00:53:39.003 --> 00:53:40.964
Danny's necklace.

00:53:43.633 --> 00:53:45.760
I hate the subway at rush hour.

00:53:46.427 --> 00:53:51.474
It's hard enough to find a seat, and if you do,
someone's pissed in it or thrown up over it.

00:53:51.599 --> 00:53:54.227
This damn heat is killing me, man.

00:53:54.602 --> 00:53:56.229
Hey, it's me!

00:53:56.312 --> 00:53:58.773
- I look great!
- Oh, shut up.

00:53:58.898 --> 00:54:00.358
No autographs, Pop.

00:54:00.483 --> 00:54:03.486
- Look. There's two seats right there.
- Don't touch me!

00:54:03.569 --> 00:54:05.947
Hey! Get off!

00:54:07.991 --> 00:54:09.784
This shit never ends.

00:54:12.996 --> 00:54:14.706
- After you.
- Asshole!

00:54:14.831 --> 00:54:17.834
- Excuse me. Police business.
- Get out of my way!

00:54:18.918 --> 00:54:22.422
Hey, baby. Besame mucho. Come on!

00:54:25.633 --> 00:54:27.594
You look like a sympathetic dude.

00:54:28.052 --> 00:54:30.972
My, uh... partner here needs an operation.

00:54:31.055 --> 00:54:34.475
But we're a little short of cash,
if you know what I mean?

00:54:35.018 --> 00:54:36.811
No need for that.

00:54:36.936 --> 00:54:38.271
Mm, money.

00:54:38.354 --> 00:54:40.148
Get the hell away from me!

00:54:40.273 --> 00:54:43.192
I know how to use this thing!
Don't make me use this thing!

00:54:43.985 --> 00:54:46.279
Bet mine's bigger than yours!

00:54:46.404 --> 00:54:47.864
I'll take that.

00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:52.869
- Hold it. Police!
- We're in trouble now.

00:54:52.952 --> 00:54:55.413
- Nobody move!
- Alto, policía, no se muevan!

00:54:55.496 --> 00:54:58.666
Everybody take a deep breath,
loosen your sphincters.

00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:01.544
We don't need any rush-hour Rambos there.

00:55:01.628 --> 00:55:03.421
Tu también, motherfucking baby!

00:55:03.546 --> 00:55:05.757
Drop it and sit down! Siéntate!

00:55:08.092 --> 00:55:10.053
What the hell is that?

00:55:14.724 --> 00:55:17.560
Leona, you OK?

00:55:17.936 --> 00:55:22.065
This is it! He's in the train!
Get these people out of here!

00:55:24.651 --> 00:55:26.611
Jerry!

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:29.113
What's happening?

00:55:50.218 --> 00:55:52.178
Get down! Get down!

00:55:52.887 --> 00:55:54.597
Get out of the way!

00:55:54.722 --> 00:55:56.683
Jerry!

00:55:56.766 --> 00:55:58.643
Leona!

00:55:58.726 --> 00:56:01.562
Leona, get 'em out! Go! Go!

00:56:05.566 --> 00:56:07.527
Now!

00:56:07.777 --> 00:56:09.237
Now!

00:56:28.798 --> 00:56:32.218
Jerry!

00:56:32.635 --> 00:56:34.679
Leona, do it!

00:56:34.804 --> 00:56:36.764
Now!

00:56:57.285 --> 00:56:59.245
Hey! Over here!

00:57:00.079 --> 00:57:02.832
Yeah, that's right. Come and get it.

00:57:08.087 --> 00:57:10.048
Come on! Move it! Move it!

00:57:10.632 --> 00:57:11.799
Let's go! Vamos!

00:57:15.887 --> 00:57:17.221
Yeah.

00:57:18.973 --> 00:57:20.767
Move it!

00:57:20.892 --> 00:57:24.646
Don't panic, just go! Go! Vamos!

00:57:36.199 --> 00:57:38.409
Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you?

00:57:40.119 --> 00:57:41.829
Wait!

00:57:49.921 --> 00:57:52.674
Vamos! Vamos! Come on!

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.933
Keep walking! Come on, you too! Vámonos!

00:58:02.684 --> 00:58:04.560
Come on, motherfucker!

00:58:04.644 --> 00:58:06.688
Want some candy?

00:58:06.896 --> 00:58:08.690
Let's dance!

00:58:13.695 --> 00:58:15.655
Come on, get out of the way!

00:58:15.947 --> 00:58:17.907
Get out of the way!

00:58:36.509 --> 00:58:38.469
Come on, out! Out! Out!

00:58:39.387 --> 00:58:41.598
Come on, move it!

00:58:41.723 --> 00:58:45.643
That way! That way!
Towards the light! The light!

00:58:45.727 --> 00:58:47.687
Come on! Get out!

00:58:49.314 --> 00:58:51.274
Come on.

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:55.820
Vamos!

00:59:49.374 --> 00:59:51.334
Oh, God.

00:59:59.926 --> 01:00:01.886
Jerry.

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:33.251
God, not again.

01:00:34.252 --> 01:00:36.379
OK, move your ass! Move out the way!

01:00:38.298 --> 01:00:41.968
- Watch out! What's happening?
- It's a fucking slaughter, Lieutenant.

01:00:42.051 --> 01:00:44.012
Oh, God!

01:00:46.306 --> 01:00:47.682
Hey, Jerry!

01:00:48.099 --> 01:00:50.226
Oh, Leona! Leona!

01:00:50.351 --> 01:00:53.104
Oh, please. Leona... oh.

01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:57.442
- How's she doing?
- Deep shock, but she's alive.

01:00:59.652 --> 01:01:02.113
I hear foetal heart sounds. She's pregnant.

01:01:02.238 --> 01:01:04.282
Let's move. LA County. Stat!

01:01:07.452 --> 01:01:09.078
Stand back.

01:01:09.203 --> 01:01:11.164
On three. One, two, three. Load up.

01:01:11.289 --> 01:01:12.999
Out of my way!

01:01:13.082 --> 01:01:15.919
Move out the way! Move it! Move it!

01:01:26.888 --> 01:01:28.848
Man!

01:01:33.311 --> 01:01:36.314
Uh, wait a minute. Let me see.

01:01:41.945 --> 01:01:44.072
- Where's Jerry?
- I don't know.

01:01:45.114 --> 01:01:46.741
We found his badge.

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:50.870
Who got hit this time?

01:01:50.954 --> 01:01:52.830
Five gang members...

01:01:52.914 --> 01:01:54.791
...bunch of commuters.

01:01:54.916 --> 01:01:56.876
Doesn't make sense.

01:01:57.502 --> 01:01:59.462
They were all armed.

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.674
- What do you mean?
- It's the chief.

01:02:03.258 --> 01:02:04.884
Wait here. Yeah?

01:02:05.009 --> 01:02:09.389
- What the hell's going on down there?
- It's a damn nightmare. Civilians this time.

01:02:09.514 --> 01:02:11.724
- Allkilled?
- Yeah. Justlike the others.

01:02:11.849 --> 01:02:13.309
Damn!

01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:04.027
Jerry!

01:03:24.464 --> 01:03:27.216
Holy shit! What the hell is going on here?

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:32.180
Hey, guys, get the camera on!
Get the camera on this right now!

01:03:32.305 --> 01:03:34.515
Get that goddamn thing on film!

01:03:35.266 --> 01:03:37.310
What's going on?

01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:39.687
Hey! Hey!

01:03:43.775 --> 01:03:45.401
Hey, Harrigan!

01:03:45.526 --> 01:03:47.654
More victims! More mutilations!

01:03:48.529 --> 01:03:50.990
- Fuck you!
- Pope!

01:03:51.491 --> 01:03:54.410
Pope? Are you there, Pope?
Pope, what's going on?

01:05:53.404 --> 01:05:55.281
Sir, the cop is back.

01:05:55.365 --> 01:05:57.325
Goddamn.

01:06:00.662 --> 01:06:04.582
Harrigan! Don't you show up
in the damnedest places.

01:06:06.084 --> 01:06:09.587
Come here, Lieutenant.
I got something you might find interesting.

01:06:10.672 --> 01:06:12.048
What is this?

01:06:12.131 --> 01:06:16.177
How many times do I have to tell you?
You don't know what you're dealing with.

01:06:18.763 --> 01:06:21.516
There's your killer. Wonderful, isn't it?

01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:25.061
Pheromone signature left by his body.
Scent molecules.

01:06:25.144 --> 01:06:27.272
Punch up three.

01:06:27.397 --> 01:06:32.610
Ten years ago one of his kind eliminated an
elite Special Forces crew in Central America.

01:06:32.694 --> 01:06:34.487
There were two survivors.

01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:39.576
They indicated that, when trapped,
the creature activated a self-destruct device...

01:06:39.659 --> 01:06:43.580
...that destroyed enough rainforest
to cover 300 city blocks.

01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:45.999
Remarkable weaponry.

01:06:46.124 --> 01:06:49.377
That's right, Lieutenant.
Other-world life forms.

01:06:51.713 --> 01:06:53.756
A fucking alien!

01:06:54.799 --> 01:06:59.679
Iwo Jima, Cambodia, Beirut.
Drawn by heat and conflict.

01:06:59.804 --> 01:07:04.684
He's on safari. Lions. The tigers. The bears.

01:07:04.809 --> 01:07:06.269
Oh, my!

01:07:06.728 --> 01:07:09.564
Trophies. That's the game, isn't it, Keyes?

01:07:09.689 --> 01:07:11.649
You're the lion.

01:07:12.483 --> 01:07:14.110
This is his jungle.

01:07:14.193 --> 01:07:18.114
- So why can't we see him?
- Defensive adaptations are astounding.

01:07:18.197 --> 01:07:21.284
It's somehow able to bend light.
Perfect camouflage.

01:07:21.409 --> 01:07:24.412
- You admire the son of a bitch.
- Not what he does.

01:07:24.537 --> 01:07:26.331
For what he is.

01:07:26.414 --> 01:07:28.124
For what he can give us.

01:07:28.249 --> 01:07:30.960
A new era of scientific technology.

01:07:31.044 --> 01:07:35.173
I've waited a lifetime for this,
and I'm not going to miss the chance.

01:07:37.008 --> 01:07:39.636
We have something
on the pheromone scanners.

01:07:46.517 --> 01:07:51.397
- Target one is on the roof.
- It's taken us two weeks to learn his patterns.

01:07:51.481 --> 01:07:53.608
He comes here every two days to feed.

01:07:53.691 --> 01:07:57.820
- Seems he has a taste for beef.
- I didn't think he was vegetarian.

01:07:57.946 --> 01:08:00.657
Well, we've prepared a trap for this predator.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:04.661
We are certain that this being
can see in only one spectrum of light -

01:08:04.744 --> 01:08:07.413
...infrared.
- Infrared?

01:08:07.497 --> 01:08:11.501
- He hunts by seeing our heat.
- Block the heat and he's blind.

01:08:11.584 --> 01:08:14.754
These suits insulate body heat,
making the team invisible.

01:08:14.879 --> 01:08:17.340
We've flooded the place
with radioactive dust...

01:08:17.465 --> 01:08:21.219
...and installed powerful
ultraviolet lighting everywhere.

01:08:21.302 --> 01:08:25.223
The dust adheres to his body,
making him visible.

01:08:25.306 --> 01:08:29.435
Liquid nitrogen. You're not gonna kill him.
You're gonna freeze him.

01:08:29.519 --> 01:08:32.689
- We have to capture him.
- He's moving.

01:08:32.772 --> 01:08:34.565
Finally.

01:08:35.316 --> 01:08:37.527
Grab a seat. Enjoy the show.

01:08:37.652 --> 01:08:39.612
This is history.

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:56.254
Capture and isolation
is our objective.

01:08:56.337 --> 01:08:58.798
Defensive action only on my orders.

01:09:00.341 --> 01:09:02.635
Power up. Lights on. Let's get him!

01:09:17.233 --> 01:09:18.693
We're in.

01:09:18.776 --> 01:09:20.820
Switch to ultraviolet.

01:09:20.903 --> 01:09:25.199
- Radio silence. Out.
- Engage ultraviolet units A through J.

01:09:49.933 --> 01:09:53.853
- What's all this interference?
- Correcting the problem, sir.

01:11:07.594 --> 01:11:09.637
They're moving to the second level.

01:11:09.762 --> 01:11:13.808
Target's still moving,
heading towards the number two stairwell.

01:11:15.018 --> 01:11:16.978
Playing right into it.

01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:33.494
Wait a minute.

01:11:33.703 --> 01:11:35.496
It's stopped.

01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:07.422
It's moving back against the wall.

01:13:07.547 --> 01:13:10.091
It's backing up. It's moving away from them.

01:13:10.174 --> 01:13:12.051
Your boys have been made.

01:13:12.176 --> 01:13:17.223
- Sir, it's circling around behind them.
- Get 'em out! They're walking into a trap!

01:13:18.683 --> 01:13:22.103
Keyes, he's behind you.
Third floor structure. Right there!

01:13:22.186 --> 01:13:24.564
Who is this? Clear the line.

01:13:24.647 --> 01:13:28.568
He sees the damn lights.
Turn 'em off! Turn 'em off! Shit!

01:13:29.193 --> 01:13:30.653
Stop him!

01:13:37.493 --> 01:13:39.787
- Door. Open it.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.915
OK. OK.

01:13:42.498 --> 01:13:43.833
The door.

01:13:43.917 --> 01:13:46.461
- Yes, sir.
- You don't know what you're doing.

01:13:46.544 --> 01:13:48.588
It's open.

01:13:48.838 --> 01:13:52.175
- You'll ruin everything!
- Fuck yourself!

01:13:53.217 --> 01:13:56.721
Defensive formation one.
Nitrogen guns, safeties off.

01:13:56.846 --> 01:13:58.640
Everyone else, rock'n'roll.

01:13:58.765 --> 01:14:00.725
This is it.

01:14:11.569 --> 01:14:13.363
He's moving down from the right.

01:14:14.072 --> 01:14:16.991
Garber, where is he? I can't see him.

01:14:17.825 --> 01:14:19.619
He's right there! He's right there!

01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:23.414
Goddamn it! Where is he?
Well, give me a coordinate! Where is he?

01:14:26.334 --> 01:14:28.711
- Watch out!
- My God.

01:14:28.795 --> 01:14:31.714
Watch your crossfire!

01:14:38.346 --> 01:14:39.722
What...

01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:41.516
I'm losing my pressure.

01:15:08.585 --> 01:15:10.545
Keyes, you all right?

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:12.797
Keyes, it's overhere!

01:15:27.312 --> 01:15:29.355
Come on! Switch over!

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.441
Shit! I can't see!

01:15:35.945 --> 01:15:38.323
They're gone.

01:15:38.823 --> 01:15:40.700
They're all dead.

01:16:32.043 --> 01:16:34.504
You want me? Here I am!

01:20:30.657 --> 01:20:32.617
You are one...

01:20:33.243 --> 01:20:34.702
...ugly mother...

01:20:37.205 --> 01:20:38.915
Motherfucker!

01:21:17.704 --> 01:21:19.581
Guess who's back.

01:21:21.958 --> 01:21:23.918
Too late to go home now.

01:21:38.683 --> 01:21:41.769
Get out of here, Harrigan.
I'm gonna save your ass.

01:21:41.894 --> 01:21:44.647
This is between me and him!

01:22:33.696 --> 01:22:35.657
God...

01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:33.798
Birds.

01:23:34.757 --> 01:23:36.718
Damn birds.

01:24:46.746 --> 01:24:48.706
OK, pussyface.

01:24:49.457 --> 01:24:51.501
It's your move.

01:24:51.584 --> 01:24:54.420
Shit happens.

01:26:33.186 --> 01:26:35.730
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:26:38.775 --> 01:26:40.735
That's all I need is birds.

01:26:41.486 --> 01:26:43.446
You can do it.

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:48.660
I can do it. I can do it.

01:26:49.994 --> 01:26:51.955
It's like falling off a log.

01:27:04.968 --> 01:27:07.428
Like a 30-storey log. Damn!

01:27:25.446 --> 01:27:28.157
Maybe I'll get lucky and fall.

01:28:09.532 --> 01:28:11.492
Damn it.

01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:30.803
The finalJeopardyansweris this:

01:28:30.929 --> 01:28:35.808
...Berengaria, who neversetfootin England,
was its queen for eightyears...

01:28:35.934 --> 01:28:39.354
...aftermarrying this king on Cyprus.

01:28:39.437 --> 01:28:41.397
Goodluck.

01:28:41.856 --> 01:28:43.650
Herb?

01:28:43.733 --> 01:28:47.070
Herb, wake up!
There's somebody in the bathroom.

01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:56.162
Herb!

01:30:13.072 --> 01:30:17.076
- It's all right. I'm a cop.
- I don't think he gives a shit.

01:30:19.704 --> 01:30:21.414
Shit!

01:30:21.539 --> 01:30:23.499
Get back inside!

01:30:31.174 --> 01:30:33.843
Holy Moses. Not again. Shit!

01:30:35.053 --> 01:30:37.013
Son of a bitch.

01:30:37.931 --> 01:30:39.891
Oh, God.

01:30:45.063 --> 01:30:47.523
Why can't this guy stay on the ground?

01:30:49.692 --> 01:30:52.403
Come on, come on. Come on, come on!

01:30:52.487 --> 01:30:54.530
Come to Papa.

01:31:00.745 --> 01:31:03.665
Stop! Stop the elevator!

01:31:04.249 --> 01:31:06.042
Stop it!

01:31:35.655 --> 01:31:37.615
Now where the hell am I?

01:31:55.091 --> 01:31:57.051
Where are you?

01:32:51.356 --> 01:32:53.650
Jesus Christ.

01:35:07.367 --> 01:35:09.327
That's right, asshole!

01:35:10.328 --> 01:35:12.205
Shit happens!

01:36:54.557 --> 01:36:57.393
OK. Who's next?

01:37:44.399 --> 01:37:46.359
Take... it.

01:37:50.738 --> 01:37:52.699
"1715."

01:40:45.413 --> 01:40:48.833
Harrigan!
What the fuck happened in there, huh?

01:40:56.799 --> 01:40:59.010
Goddamn it. We came so close!

01:41:08.603 --> 01:41:13.066
Don't worry, asshole.
You'll get another chance.
