WEBVTT

00:58.767 --> 01:02.562
The heat wave continues.
lt's 109 degrees in Los Angeles.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.777
As drought-ridden Los Angeles
swelters in agonizing heat,

01:50.861 --> 01:53.696
drug lords wage warfare in the streets.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.700
Yet another open conflict...
Oh, fuck this! Get me out of here!

02:06.710 --> 02:12.215
We're in a war zone, Dave: two motorcycle
officers horribly wounded in a crossfire,

02:12.299 --> 02:14.550
the police seemingly
unable to rescue them

02:14.635 --> 02:17.345
in spite of several
desperate, heroic attempts.

02:17.429 --> 02:20.681
lt's completely out of control down here.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.483
My beautiful cantina,
everything l own, they shot it to pieces.

02:30.567 --> 02:36.572
My microwave, my automatic steamer,
my grill... You fucking pendejos!

03:10.774 --> 03:11.524
Fuck you!

03:14.820 --> 03:18.364
Tony Pope, live with Hard Core,
on the scene and in your face.

03:18.448 --> 03:22.535
lt's like Dante's hell:
smoke, fire, oppressive heat,

03:22.619 --> 03:28.666
as Colombian and Jamaican drug fiends
again transform LA into a slaughterhouse.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.169
Who the hell's in charge down here?
The cops? Uh-uh.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.464
They're outmanned,
outgunned and incompetent.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.551
Mr. Mayor,
on vacation in your home in Lake Tahoe,

03:38.635 --> 03:42.471
get off your butt,
get down here and declare martial law!

04:08.290 --> 04:10.750
OK, don't keep me in suspense,
Danny boy!

04:10.834 --> 04:13.085
lt has not been a nice day!

04:13.170 --> 04:18.090
Two motors pulled over a truck, stumbled
right in the middle of a narc stakeout.

04:18.175 --> 04:22.386
You know, ten Colombians
and Scorpios armed to fuck all.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.305
They're trying to get in their headquarters.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.935
We're keeping them pinned down,
but those officers are bleeding to death.

04:29.019 --> 04:34.690
- Fuck! They're dying, man.
- Where the hell is Special Weapons?

04:34.775 --> 04:38.903
They're still tied up in that shootout
in San Pedro with the Jamaicans.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.529
They shot down a chopper.

04:40.614 --> 04:45.117
Mills and Johnson won't last much longer.
We need an assault vehicle to go get 'em.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.412
l'm gonna chat with these assholes.
When l give the signal,

04:48.497 --> 04:50.831
- give me some cover!
- Got it!

05:07.557 --> 05:08.891
Too small.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.560
Right.

05:47.097 --> 05:51.559
Come on! Come on!
Get 'em out of here! Now!

05:56.690 --> 05:57.940
Vamonos!

06:01.737 --> 06:03.779
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!

06:21.590 --> 06:23.632
- Vamonos!
- Vamonos!

06:46.865 --> 06:48.407
Hey, assholes!

07:09.012 --> 07:12.306
- Mike, are you OK?
- Yeah. Let's get the rest.

07:12.390 --> 07:17.103
We can't. Orders from Chief Heinemann.
He says surround building and wait.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.105
- Wait for what?
- l don't know!

07:19.189 --> 07:22.483
Some bullshit special unit.
The feds, the DEA.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.986
lf we let those bastards get dug in now,
we'll have to level the building!

07:27.239 --> 07:30.950
- Hijo de puta.
- No, es para mi.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.620
- Vamonos! Vamonos!
- Venga! Aprisa!

07:34.704 --> 07:39.458
Venga! Chingale! Chingale!

07:46.216 --> 07:50.636
Come and get it. El Scorpio is ready.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.568
- Sarge, any of your people in the building?
- No.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.361
Let's go.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.531
Lieutenant, can't let you in.
Heinemann's on his way.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.951
Heinemann can kiss my sweet ass!
Come on!

08:14.035 --> 08:16.245
Goddamn it. Go with him.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.273
Three, two, one...

08:44.357 --> 08:45.941
Go!

08:54.492 --> 08:55.784
Get back.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.539
Next door over.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.850
Take this room!

09:23.897 --> 09:27.024
First floor, officer down. We need backup.

09:45.961 --> 09:49.421
Freeze! l said hold it!

09:49.506 --> 09:54.468
Now, lay your guns down.
You can walk down or fly, it's your choice.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.929
l said put it down, asshole!

09:59.808 --> 10:00.849
No!

10:25.208 --> 10:28.002
- Let's do it now!
- Take it easy.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.843
Damn, it's hot.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.162
Must be losing it.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.999
Mike!

11:07.083 --> 11:09.668
Spread out. Secure the roof.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.296
Just take it easy. l'm right here.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.342
All clear. All clear on the site.

11:16.426 --> 11:21.555
Oh, Danny boy.
l gotta get down from here.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.267
Shit.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.813
OK, search the roof.
Check every floor. Maybe someone else...

11:29.898 --> 11:34.943
Seal it off. No one leaves.
Danny, get me off this damn roof.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.115
- You get the rest of them?
- Somebody beat us to it.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.462
Leona.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.311
Oh, shit.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.962
- What happened to El Scorpio?
- He's out front having lunch.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.589
What the hell is this?

12:37.674 --> 12:42.136
l don't know. They've been cut to pieces.
Must be the Jamaicans.

12:42.220 --> 12:45.347
Their style, but where the hell did they go?

12:45.432 --> 12:49.852
OK, nobody gets in here
until Forensic arrives. Nobody.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.854
OK, you know the drill.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.677
Mike. Up there.

13:30.768 --> 13:35.272
He must have been killed out here,
and then someone...

13:37.025 --> 13:41.737
That's about 35, 40 feet.
No rope, no ladder.

13:41.821 --> 13:47.784
The guy weighs about 1 90, 1 95 pounds.
You couldn't carry him up there.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.621
Lieutenant?

13:50.705 --> 13:55.250
Deputy Chief Heinemann's downstairs.
He wants you out of the building now.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.961
Son of a bitch.

13:58.046 --> 14:02.508
- What the fuck is going on?
- This is not good, Mike. Not good at all.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.766
- l want a real name on this joker, OK?
- You got it.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.017
Mike.

14:13.561 --> 14:18.190
Phil, this is quite a surprise.
What brings you down from the palace?

14:18.274 --> 14:22.778
You let me down, Mike.
You're making me look bad.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.113
l thought we had an understanding.

14:25.198 --> 14:30.452
l put my ass on the line to get you here,
and all l expect is a little cooperation!

14:32.455 --> 14:34.665
You were told this was a federal matter.

14:34.749 --> 14:37.459
Yet you disobeyed an order
to stay out of the building.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.338
Don't let this get out, Phil,
but it's a fucking war down here.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.132
Soldiers take orders. Don't push it!

14:44.217 --> 14:48.053
l'll push it as far as l can, Phil,
cos we're fighting for our lives here,

14:48.137 --> 14:51.932
while you're downtown
pushing pencils and kissing ass!

14:54.310 --> 14:57.437
l don't roll over for anybody,
especially the feds,

14:57.522 --> 14:59.648
without a goddamn good explanation!

15:23.172 --> 15:27.551
Take this equipment up to the third floor.
Come on, let's move!

15:38.938 --> 15:41.315
- Let's go.
- Excuse me, sir!

15:41.399 --> 15:43.775
What the hell is going on here,
Heinemann?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.737
lnsubordination.
Disregard for direct orders

15:46.821 --> 15:48.447
from a supervising officer.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.033
Now get back to your cage at Alvarado.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.744
l'll show you insubordination, you son of...

15:53.828 --> 15:56.705
- No!
- Where you running to? Come here!

15:56.789 --> 15:59.458
You don't need this, Mike.
lt's not worth it.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.711
- Relax.
- Oh, fuck!

16:23.191 --> 16:25.025
l have an update for you.

16:25.109 --> 16:28.570
ln a shootout, five members
of one Colombian drug gang

16:28.655 --> 16:33.116
were ambushed by their bloody rivals,
the Jamaican Voodoo Posse,

16:33.201 --> 16:37.204
who escaped without a trace -
again making total fools of...

16:37.288 --> 16:40.248
- A detective is here to see you.
- Back there.

16:40.333 --> 16:45.128
Listen, lady, you got a backed-up toilet.
Call a plumber, not the cops.

16:45.213 --> 16:50.133
- This license has expired.
- Bullshit! l paid that fee six months ago.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.886
- l'll kick your ass!
- Sit down! Right now!

16:52.970 --> 16:56.556
- Move! Get your ass movin'!
- Just calm the fuck down!

16:59.185 --> 17:01.103
What you lookin' at?

17:03.147 --> 17:08.568
And all you got to do
is tee it high and let it fly.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.446
Dead solid perfect.

17:11.531 --> 17:16.702
Now, remember, for distance
you gotta gently but firmly grip the club.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.205
Lieutenant Harrigan!
Detective Lambert, Rampart Division.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.333
Hey, kid, just have a seat.
l'll be right with you.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.752
- Hey, Cap.
- Don't start, Mike.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.546
Heinemann's already
been up my ass so far

17:27.630 --> 17:31.216
l won't be able to sit down for a week.
We're not winning this war.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.678
As much as it'll piss you off,
you'll have to play the game.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.431
"Effective immediately,
a federal task force

17:37.515 --> 17:41.435
under Special Agent Peter Keyes
will investigate criminal activities

17:41.519 --> 17:46.398
involving the trafficking
of controlled substances."

17:46.482 --> 17:49.568
And you will extend him
your full cooperation.

17:49.652 --> 17:52.446
So you're cutting off my dick
and shoving it up my ass.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.616
The feds are calling the shots on this.
My hands are tied!

17:56.701 --> 18:01.037
- Yeah?
- Captain Pilgrim, Peter Keyes.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.957
- lt's good to meet you.
- And you, sir.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.461
Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.
Special Agent Peter Keyes, DEA.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.088
Heard a lot about you.

18:10.173 --> 18:16.386
l'm sorry for this jurisdictional intrusion.
Don't mean to be stepping on your toes.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.764
But we want to prevent
King Willie's voodoo gangs

18:18.848 --> 18:23.518
from taking over the entire West Coast.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.687
l wish l could tell you more.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.775
But we have a large number
of deep-cover operatives involved.

18:29.859 --> 18:34.070
You know how it is.
We all have a job to do.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.448
Now, l'm sure we can respect
each other's situation

18:36.532 --> 18:39.701
and act responsibly.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.120
Well,

18:42.205 --> 18:45.373
cooperation

18:45.458 --> 18:47.167
is my middle name.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.634
l'll see you around.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.519
- l'm the new transfer, Jerry Lambert.
- Like l said, have a seat.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.937
l'll be right with you.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.940
- Who is this dude?
- Yeah, what an asshole.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.277
All right, Danny boy, what we got?

19:14.362 --> 19:18.490
What have we got? Five lowlife Scorpions
make it into the building.

19:18.574 --> 19:23.328
The next minute they're all shish kabob.
Not one bullet wound.

19:23.412 --> 19:26.081
lt wasn't drugs or money.
There's a shitload of that.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.377
Maybe King Willie brought in some
outside talent. He's making his big move.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.754
A pro would have split
the moment he heard us.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.006
More than one, we would have seen them.

19:35.091 --> 19:38.134
Whoever did this
waited until the last minute,

19:38.219 --> 19:42.681
and then took out four men
armed with machine guns by hand!

19:42.765 --> 19:45.016
And then got by us.

19:45.101 --> 19:48.311
Maybe we should give him a job.
Let's put him on the payroll.

19:48.396 --> 19:52.357
So me and my partner bolt up the stairs,
somebody is screaming bloody murder...

19:52.441 --> 19:55.193
- You gotta hear this.
- What?!

19:55.278 --> 19:59.281
Hey, l forgot to tell you.
See that guy there?

19:59.365 --> 20:02.868
That's Ferris's replacement.

20:02.952 --> 20:06.872
This guy's Jerry Lambert.
The Lone Ranger from Rampart station.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.665
That's the Lone Ranger?

20:08.749 --> 20:11.626
l thought he was here
to fix the air conditioning.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.255
l said "Lady, you are under arrest."
And she said "Why?"

20:15.339 --> 20:18.967
l said "Because your husband is dead.
You killed him."

20:19.051 --> 20:21.678
- Know what she said, didn't miss a beat?
- No.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.347
She said "l stabbed that
son of a bitch plenty of times.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.850
He never died on me before."

20:30.146 --> 20:34.316
Looks like he's putting the moves
to Leona.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.443
His first big mistake.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.575
- l have heard about you.
- Yeah?

20:43.659 --> 20:46.786
- Like your last partner got shot.
- What?

20:46.871 --> 20:49.080
Well...

20:49.206 --> 20:54.461
You try that cowboy shit with me, fucker,
you can kiss these goodbye.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.047
- Got it?
- Yeah, l got it.

20:57.131 --> 21:01.927
Well, well, l see that
the three of you have met.

21:02.011 --> 21:06.890
Lambert, if you're feeling up to it,
why don't you limp your way in

21:06.974 --> 21:10.644
to the lieutenant. He wants to talk to you.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.649
- You're a bad girl.
- l like that.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.070
Goddamn, is that bitch on the rag
or what?

21:24.200 --> 21:30.121
This is what l call "the speech," kid.
l only give it once, so pay attention.

21:30.206 --> 21:35.043
Until now, it's all been fun and games,
cops and robbers, dunking doughnuts.

21:36.504 --> 21:40.340
But you're in the shit now.
Metro Command is a war zone.

21:40.424 --> 21:44.636
Lieutenant, l've paid my dues.
l had to bust my ass to get my transfer.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.638
And that scares the shit out of me, kid.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.641
No one requests to come here
unless they want a reputation.

21:49.725 --> 21:54.479
There's no room for anyone looking
to prove themselves. l won't stand for it.

21:54.563 --> 21:59.651
Don't get me wrong. We need good cops,
and they say you're good at what you do.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.070
But the team comes first.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.157
You live by that, and you'll be OK.
And we'll all be there for you.

22:06.242 --> 22:10.912
Remember, the door swings both ways.
That's it.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.253
Hey, kid.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.256
Welcome to the war.

22:47.908 --> 22:51.244
OK, guys. This has gone too far now, huh?

22:53.247 --> 22:56.082
Hey, guys.

22:56.167 --> 23:00.503
l know you're trying to scare me, huh?

23:00.588 --> 23:05.467
Well, you did a pretty good job, man.
l'm scared now.

23:07.303 --> 23:14.225
Stop it now. l can pay you.
$2 million, man. ln cash.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.353
- Right now!
- This is not about money.

23:17.438 --> 23:20.732
This is about power!

23:20.816 --> 23:26.529
There's a new king in the streets.
This is a message he has for your people.

23:26.614 --> 23:31.826
You are history.
Fucking history, goddamn puto.

23:41.253 --> 23:46.174
What the fuck are you doing now, man?
You're crazy!

23:46.258 --> 23:49.135
King Willie says

23:49.220 --> 23:52.639
not only do l have to kill you,

23:56.060 --> 23:58.269
but l have to take your soul.

24:03.567 --> 24:07.862
Voodoo magic.
Fucking voodoo magic, man.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.204
But you know what?
l tell you what l believe.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.917
Shit happens.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.976
Shoot it!

25:09.925 --> 25:11.718
Fucker!

25:37.494 --> 25:39.287
Shit happens.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.719
l'm standing just outside
a penthouse complex in San Pedro...

25:54.803 --> 25:58.431
..involving as many as 20 people.
lt's uncertain who they were.

25:58.515 --> 26:02.477
One report indicates it might be
the feared Jamaican Voodoo Posse.

26:02.561 --> 26:07.649
l go in for my physical and the doctor says
"l need a semen, stool and urine sample."

26:07.733 --> 26:12.278
l say "Gee, doc, l'm in a big hurry.
Can l just leave my underwear?"

26:12.363 --> 26:13.655
Oh, God.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.911
Word is there may be as many as
50 more dead bodies up there.

26:19.995 --> 26:23.873
Oh, man, it's Pope.
That parasite must live in his car.

26:23.958 --> 26:26.584
l'll handle it. PR's my specialty.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.920
Word is they want your ass off the job.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.214
- Tony!
- Who the hell are you?

26:31.298 --> 26:33.925
Your biggest fan!
Catch your show all the time.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.093
l got a job to do!

26:35.177 --> 26:37.095
Yourjob is to root for garbage elsewhere.

26:37.179 --> 26:38.930
- Been inside?
- Yeah.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.350
We were gonna go in with our guys,
but we were told on a radio transmission

26:42.434 --> 26:44.811
nobody goes in under any circumstances.

26:44.895 --> 26:50.608
All units, be advised.
Federal officers will handle investigation.

26:50.693 --> 26:53.528
- We didn't hear that. Let's go.
- You're the boss.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.948
This is Cheryl Tyer reporting live...

26:57.032 --> 26:59.867
Hey, nice flashlight. Mind if l borrow it?

27:08.043 --> 27:09.043
OK.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.430
Damn!

27:23.726 --> 27:25.435
Look familiar?

27:27.229 --> 27:28.313
Fuck.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.232
Oh, God.

27:32.443 --> 27:37.655
Ramon Vega, the crack king. Biggest
operator in East LA. 1 00 keys a week.

27:37.740 --> 27:42.577
- Why isn't he skinned? And who are they?
- Jamaicans. King Willie's boys.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.621
That makes no sense.
This was a voodoo ritual.

27:45.706 --> 27:48.499
l've seen it before. They took his heart out.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.835
- What for?
- Terror tactics, man.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.672
You know,
to scare the shit out of their enemies.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.592
- King Willie.
- Who the hell is King Willie?

27:57.676 --> 28:01.846
King Willie, voodoo priest
of the LA posses.

28:01.930 --> 28:05.183
Ran the terror gangs
for Edward Seaga in Jamaica

28:05.267 --> 28:07.310
till he got too powerful.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.188
The Jamaican chiefs
won't make a move without his approval.

28:10.272 --> 28:13.483
So what the fuck happened? Shit!

28:16.111 --> 28:18.071
Hey, we got a survivor!

28:26.997 --> 28:29.707
What's she saying?

28:29.792 --> 28:32.502
l don't know. She's not making any sense.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.962
She keeps saying
"El diablo vino por ellos."

28:35.047 --> 28:36.756
The devil came for them.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.341
lf it's the Colombians,

28:38.425 --> 28:42.595
why'd they leave their boss hanging
and his girl naked on the floor?

28:42.679 --> 28:45.890
- lt wasn't the Colombians.
- Our friend from the armory.

28:45.974 --> 28:51.229
Right. We got a new player in town.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.898
Come over here, Mike. Check this out.

28:58.195 --> 29:00.321
What is that?

29:00.406 --> 29:03.658
Looks like a spear tip or something.

29:04.827 --> 29:09.163
This is a restricted area.
l want it cleared immediately.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.749
You're walking on physical evidence.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.085
- We'll take care of her.
- She's with me.

29:14.169 --> 29:18.214
Lieutenant, l'd like
a word with you in private, please.

29:22.845 --> 29:26.139
They say that persistence
is your most outstanding quality.

29:26.223 --> 29:29.267
- l know this is your show...
- You're not listening to me!

29:29.351 --> 29:32.770
You got a big nose and
you're sticking it too far in my business.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.272
Maybe you can hear this.

29:34.356 --> 29:38.276
The next time you cross me,
you're gonna turn up missing.

29:39.361 --> 29:40.736
Garber, the man with the camera.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.530
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.617
- All right. Let's go.
- Stay away.

29:46.702 --> 29:50.163
- Hey, fuck you, man! Give me my camera!
- Shut the fuck up.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.166
Hey, wait a minute!
l got my rights! l'm a journalist.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.586
- Harrigan!
- Shut up. Let's go.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.964
Smells like a cover-up.
The press has a right to know!

30:00.048 --> 30:04.051
Take him out of the building. Search him.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.554
Now you get the hell out of here.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.183
Who the hell are you, Keyes?

30:10.267 --> 30:13.478
The last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.785
Wanna make me proud, kid?

30:29.870 --> 30:33.498
Take your bag of tricks, stay with them,
find out where they take her.

30:33.582 --> 30:37.502
Meet me later at La Cita's.
And be careful. These guys are good.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.463
Hey, don't worry!
Surveillance is my specialty.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.548
OK, then. Just get going.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.929
Go get 'em, Lone Ranger.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.641
Danny, look here.
We gotta take this real cool.

30:51.725 --> 30:55.686
These guys sure aren't the DEA,
but it's still Keyes's party.

30:55.771 --> 30:59.357
You stick around, stay out of sight.
l'll meet you at one o'clock.

30:59.441 --> 31:03.778
We'll take a good look at that room, OK?
Hey, wait for me.

31:04.446 --> 31:07.448
Danny boy, no hero stuff, understand?

31:12.746 --> 31:14.789
Watch your ass, Danny boy.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.674
She never made it.

31:24.758 --> 31:28.970
The feds were waiting.
Hustled her off in a chopper.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.224
- Let me guess. A silver Alouette?
- That very one.

31:35.811 --> 31:38.854
And guess what. Your pal Keyes
was running the whole show.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.441
- And his butt boys.
- Son of a bitch.

31:42.526 --> 31:45.194
You done real good, kid.

31:45.279 --> 31:50.408
Now tomorrow, start a tail on Keyes.
Everything he does, everywhere he goes.

31:50.492 --> 31:53.077
Who knows? You might just get lucky.

31:53.161 --> 31:57.790
Lieutenant! Luck is my specialty.

31:59.293 --> 32:00.960
Yeah. l bet it is.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.093
Now, if you'll excuse me, Lieutenant,

32:09.177 --> 32:14.307
l got some serious police work
to attend to. Come to Papa.

32:16.059 --> 32:19.687
- Hey, are your balls OK?
- Fine.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.939
How are yours?

32:22.024 --> 32:24.525
- Hey, do you mind? lt's my sister.
- Say what?

32:24.610 --> 32:26.819
Oh, you're not my sister.

32:29.031 --> 32:32.908
Son of a bitch.
Who are you really chasing, Keyes?

32:34.036 --> 32:35.745
Time to go to work.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.082
- Shit.
- Danny boy.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.667
Mike?

36:16.424 --> 36:17.633
Oh, God!

36:26.268 --> 36:28.185
Oh, Mother of God!

36:40.740 --> 36:43.325
Lieutenant Michael R Harrigan:

36:43.410 --> 36:47.246
violence prone,
obsessive/compulsive personality,

36:47.330 --> 36:50.207
a history of excessive physical force

36:50.292 --> 36:55.045
throughout his 1 8 years
as a Los Angeles police officer.

36:55.130 --> 37:00.426
Also responsible for the destruction of
1 1 patrol cars, a city bus...

37:00.510 --> 37:02.887
What about ten commendations for valor

37:02.971 --> 37:07.558
and the best felony arrest record
in the history of this department?

37:07.642 --> 37:12.980
That and my intervention on your behalf
are the only reasons you still have a job.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.024
lf it were up to the chief,

37:15.108 --> 37:19.236
he'd charge you with Detective Archuleta's
death and suspend you.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.742
As it is, he left it in my hands.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.994
Now, this John Wayne attitude

37:27.078 --> 37:30.539
and flagrant disregard for policy
is gonna end now.

37:30.624 --> 37:33.918
No one under my command will impede
the progress of this federal task force

37:34.002 --> 37:38.255
headed by Agent Keyes. No one.

37:45.263 --> 37:48.682
That's it. Dismissed.

37:55.732 --> 37:59.693
Mike, you're too close to this.
Stay out of it.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.655
lt's a police matter.
They can't keep the department out of it.

38:02.739 --> 38:05.366
We'll find Danny's killer.

38:05.450 --> 38:10.788
Captain, Danny and l came up together.
1 5 years on the fucking street!

38:10.872 --> 38:13.540
Whoever killed him's gonna pay.
l'm gonna finish it.

38:26.888 --> 38:29.056
Hey, come on. What is this?

38:35.063 --> 38:37.106
Listen, shithead.

38:37.190 --> 38:41.819
l don't give a fuck what you want with
this asshole because now it's personal.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.404
And he's a dead man.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.615
What you're dealing with
is over your head. l'm warning you...

38:46.700 --> 38:49.827
You! You don't know
what you're dealing with.

38:49.911 --> 38:53.080
And l'm warning you.
Stay the fuck out of my way!

39:05.552 --> 39:08.846
- l'll take care of him.
- No.

39:08.930 --> 39:12.725
Let him go. We're too close.

39:17.564 --> 39:22.109
..claiming as his, turf controlled by the
Jamaican and Colombian drug lords.

39:22.193 --> 39:26.030
Watch as we continue our report.

39:26.114 --> 39:30.534
Yes, the word is out: LA is up for grabs,
the spoils of our once fine city

39:30.618 --> 39:32.119
going to the ruthless scum

39:32.203 --> 39:35.748
who can spread the most
carnage and blood in our streets.

39:35.832 --> 39:37.875
The latest update on the scoreboard:

39:37.959 --> 39:42.546
five assorted trash and one good cop,
one of the best on our force.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.883
Who's next? Where's the mayor?
He's not even in the city...

39:45.967 --> 39:48.552
Forget it. lt's over.

39:48.636 --> 39:52.765
Mike, goddamn it. This ain't
your personal little war, you know.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.892
l loved Danny, too.

39:54.976 --> 39:58.395
Hey, you told me the only way
you survive is because you're a team.

39:58.480 --> 40:01.482
The door swings both ways. Remember?

40:07.155 --> 40:10.699
All right. We'll do it together.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.993
Come on. Talk to me about Keyes.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.120
We've been on him for the last three days.

40:15.205 --> 40:17.498
And they're not looking for drug dealers.

40:17.582 --> 40:21.418
Yeah. They've been setting up
weird radar sensors all over downtown.

40:21.503 --> 40:24.254
l used my whole repertory
to keep up with them!

40:24.339 --> 40:27.591
l had scanners on them,
but they scrambled my shit up.

40:27.675 --> 40:32.638
They had equipment l can't begin to touch.
And then this morning

40:32.722 --> 40:35.432
- l lost 'em.
- We lost them.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.601
- Where?
- Vernon and lndustry.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.104
- They disappeared!
- The slaughterhouse district?

40:40.188 --> 40:43.941
Yeah, and in this heat...
l mean, BO and barbecue!

40:44.025 --> 40:47.361
Whatever Keyes is looking for,
he's found it, or close to it.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.404
Leona, l want to meet with King Willie.

40:49.489 --> 40:52.741
Willie and l seem to have
the same problem.

40:52.826 --> 40:55.911
- ln the meantime, you come with me.
- Mike, it's impossible!

40:55.995 --> 40:57.579
Just do it.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.041
Fuck!

41:03.169 --> 41:07.381
- Omega 1 . This is Control.
- This is Omega 1 .

41:07.465 --> 41:10.717
We only have 22 minutes
on safe window of operation.

41:10.802 --> 41:15.139
- Yes, sir.
- Verify that final telemetry check.

41:15.223 --> 41:20.644
Start your test now.
Scan track three, two, one, mark.

41:20.728 --> 41:24.731
Number six, power up on the UV banks.

41:24.816 --> 41:28.819
We're complete on the lower UV banks.
Ready for testing.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.655
Second level,
check for ambient temperature variations.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.241
You got two minutes. Now get going.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.911
To all units. All units, you have

41:37.996 --> 41:40.998
approximately 20 minutes
to finish your task.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.167
- Roger.
- lncrease this UV.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.793
Up 42 percent.

41:48.423 --> 41:52.467
Your friend died as the result of
an intrusion in the chest cavity

41:52.552 --> 41:55.929
by an edged weapon
that nearly cleaved the heart in two.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.182
Death was instantaneous.

41:58.266 --> 42:02.102
He was boned like a fish.
l've never seen anything like this.

42:03.354 --> 42:06.440
Please, do not touch anything.

42:09.402 --> 42:13.947
Doctor, what about the other victims?
Anything there?

42:14.032 --> 42:17.451
The federal team
brought in their own forensic examiners.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.163
l am the medical examiner
and the chief pathologist in the city,

42:21.247 --> 42:22.748
and they've cut me out.

42:22.832 --> 42:26.418
Any way you can get a look at evidence
the feds have collected?

42:26.502 --> 42:30.339
- l mean, they must have run tests.
- lt won't be easy.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.633
Doctor,

42:32.717 --> 42:36.303
l pried this from Danny's hands.
This is what took him into the rafters.

42:36.387 --> 42:39.932
- lt has almost no weight.
- But it cuts like steel.

42:40.016 --> 42:41.391
Let me see.

42:44.187 --> 42:49.149
We are now at 1 50,000 times
normal magnification.

42:54.864 --> 42:57.074
Astonishing.
This material doesn't correspond

42:57.158 --> 43:00.077
to anything on the periodic table.

43:00.787 --> 43:02.329
Lieutenant, what the hell is that thing?

43:02.413 --> 43:04.915
Don't know.
lt's not from a hardware store.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.167
- Military?
- Good guess.

43:07.252 --> 43:10.087
Either something that got away,
or something they want.

43:10.171 --> 43:14.216
Keyes. Ah, we're getting closer now
to what happened...

43:14.300 --> 43:18.637
Hey, no! Easy, kid. Put your gun away.

43:18.721 --> 43:21.014
King Willie will see you now.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.062
lt's OK.

43:27.146 --> 43:29.815
- Don't you want me with you?
- l'll call you later.

43:29.899 --> 43:33.235
- You want me to follow you?
- l'll call you later!

43:37.031 --> 43:39.074
You want some ganja, man?

43:40.994 --> 43:42.703
License plate number.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.622
1 -8-8...
No, no. 1 -8-8-3...

43:45.707 --> 43:47.040
Oh, fuck!

43:57.427 --> 44:02.347
The door swings both ways, my ass.
This door swings both ways.

44:19.198 --> 44:20.949
Thanks for the ride.

44:22.243 --> 44:26.580
You know,
you guys really ought to cut down.

45:09.248 --> 45:13.668
They say you want to talk to me.

45:13.753 --> 45:17.714
They say you offering me favors.

45:21.761 --> 45:26.932
Tell me why, Babylon. Mr. Policeman.

45:27.016 --> 45:30.310
- l want some information.
- lnformation.

45:33.773 --> 45:37.109
About the one that's doing all the killing?

45:37.193 --> 45:42.364
He killed your people. Now mine.

45:42.448 --> 45:48.620
l think you know who he is. l want him.

45:48.704 --> 45:52.582
l don't know who he is.

45:52.667 --> 45:57.087
But l know where he is.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.424
- The other side.
- What are you talking about?

46:00.508 --> 46:03.760
The spirit world, man.

46:03.845 --> 46:09.266
You see, it's always the same.

46:09.350 --> 46:12.519
There's no stopping
what can't be stopped.

46:12.603 --> 46:16.231
No killing what can't be killed.

46:16.315 --> 46:18.984
- Make sense, man.
- This thing

46:19.068 --> 46:23.530
that's killing your people and mine
is from the other side.

46:23.614 --> 46:26.700
l can feel him all around.

46:26.784 --> 46:31.288
You can't see the eyes of the demon

46:31.372 --> 46:33.290
until him come calling.

46:35.418 --> 46:40.005
This is dread, man. Truly dread.

46:47.305 --> 46:51.975
Nothing else for you here, policeman.
Time to go.

47:05.615 --> 47:07.282
Prepare yourself.

48:14.308 --> 48:18.812
"His foundation lie in the holy mountain.
Selah."

49:09.864 --> 49:13.867
This is Tony Pope live from LA,
the city of fear.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.704
The psycho-vigilante killer
continues his daily diet for murder.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.331
Bodies strung out,

49:19.415 --> 49:23.376
bodies with the skins ripped off,
the hearts torn from the cadavers.

49:23.461 --> 49:26.212
And just recently,
King Willie, the drug lord,

49:26.297 --> 49:29.799
the vicious drug lord found
in an alley just around the corner

49:29.884 --> 49:34.095
with his head cut off and his
spinal column torn from the body.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.640
A fitting demise to the Prince of Powder.

49:40.561 --> 49:44.397
First Danny, then King Willie.
And you were right there!

49:44.482 --> 49:47.734
He's playing with you, Mike.
You've gotta be careful.

49:47.818 --> 49:51.780
Yeah. We all gotta be careful.
What about Keyes? Anything there?

49:51.864 --> 49:54.908
Definitely something slippery about Keyes.

49:54.992 --> 49:59.746
Seems there's a Peter J Keyes.
PhD physical sciences, Cornell.

50:00.706 --> 50:04.501
Hot out of college
and into the Strategic Defense lnstitute.

50:04.585 --> 50:08.672
Then two years later commissioned
as a captain in Air Force lntelligence.

50:08.756 --> 50:11.508
Mike, this is a dead end.
We're way out of our league!

50:11.592 --> 50:14.052
Look, l don't care who's involved.

50:14.136 --> 50:17.514
This guy killed Danny
and he's going to fall!

50:17.598 --> 50:20.684
- What about the good doctor?
- l'm here, Lieutenant.

50:20.768 --> 50:25.355
The federal authorities erased everything
from the computer file except for this:

50:25.439 --> 50:30.276
part of a chemical test on a
fragment of wood from the penthouse.

50:30.361 --> 50:36.241
And it contained traces of
cattle blood and heavy traces of steroids.

50:36.325 --> 50:39.202
l believe
whoever killed Detective Archuleta

50:39.286 --> 50:41.996
had recently been in a slaughterhouse.

50:42.081 --> 50:46.918
- That's where l lost Keyes the first time!
- That's where we'll find him.

50:47.002 --> 50:50.714
Take the metro. l'll pick you up
at Vernon station in an hour.

50:50.798 --> 50:53.800
Just because you don't see Keyes's boys
doesn't mean they're not around.

51:15.489 --> 51:18.783
l just want you to stay in the car. OK?
Your mom and l won't be very long.

51:18.868 --> 51:21.911
You sit still.
We'll be back in a few minutes.

51:21.996 --> 51:24.414
All right?

51:24.498 --> 51:26.833
- Come on, honey.
- Yes, darling.

51:26.917 --> 51:29.627
- Which way was it?
- Down here.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.843
Take that, you scum-sucking dog.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.118
Want some candy?

52:04.622 --> 52:05.914
Brian?

52:07.041 --> 52:11.628
- You come here right this minute!
- Mommy, l saw a ghost.

52:11.712 --> 52:13.379
Want some candy?

52:31.565 --> 52:32.649
Rest.

52:39.073 --> 52:40.657
Want some candy?

53:40.175 --> 53:41.801
Danny's necklace.

53:45.055 --> 53:47.432
l hate the subway at rush hour.

53:47.516 --> 53:49.559
lt's hard enough to find a seat,
and if you do,

53:49.643 --> 53:52.896
someone's pissed in it
or thrown up over it.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.607
This damn heat is killing me, man.

53:55.691 --> 53:57.233
Hey, it's me!

53:57.318 --> 53:59.527
- l look great!
- Oh, shut up.

53:59.612 --> 54:01.487
No autographs, Pop.

54:01.572 --> 54:03.781
- Look. There's two seats right there.
- Don't touch me!

54:03.866 --> 54:05.325
Hey! Get off!

54:09.246 --> 54:11.039
This shit never ends.

54:14.043 --> 54:16.044
- After you.
- Asshole!

54:16.128 --> 54:18.963
- Excuse me. Police business.
- Get out of my way!

54:19.840 --> 54:23.384
Hey, baby. Bésame mucho. Come on!

54:26.889 --> 54:32.101
You look like a sympathetic dude.
My... partner here needs an operation.

54:32.186 --> 54:36.147
But we're a little short of cash,
if you know what l mean?

54:36.231 --> 54:38.733
No need for that.

54:38.817 --> 54:41.319
- Money!
- Get the hell away from me!

54:41.403 --> 54:43.237
l know how to use this!

54:43.322 --> 54:47.116
- Don't make me use this thing!
- Bet mine's bigger than yours!

54:47.201 --> 54:50.578
l'll take that.

54:50.663 --> 54:53.957
- Hold it. Police!
- We're in trouble now.

54:54.041 --> 54:56.668
- Nobody move!
- Alto, policia, no se muevan!

54:56.752 --> 55:00.296
Everybody take a deep breath,
loosen your sphincters.

55:00.381 --> 55:02.423
We don't need
any rush-hour Rambos there.

55:02.508 --> 55:07.178
Tu también, motherfucking baby!
Drop it and sit down! Siéntate!

55:09.223 --> 55:11.307
What the hell is that?

55:16.563 --> 55:18.982
Leona, you OK?

55:19.066 --> 55:23.069
This is it! He's in the train!
Get these people out of here!

55:25.823 --> 55:29.993
Jerry! What's happening?

55:51.515 --> 55:54.767
Get down! Get out of the way!

55:55.936 --> 55:59.522
- Jerry!
- Leona!

55:59.606 --> 56:01.774
Leona, get 'em out! Go!

56:06.739 --> 56:07.780
Now!

56:30.971 --> 56:32.305
Jerry!

56:33.766 --> 56:36.934
Leona, do it! Now!

56:58.582 --> 57:04.003
Hey! Over here!
Yeah, that's right. Come and get it.

57:09.134 --> 57:13.346
Come on! Move it! Let's go! Vamos!

57:20.938 --> 57:25.608
Move it! Don't panic, just go! Go! Vamos!

57:37.037 --> 57:39.956
Jesus Christ. What the fuck are you?

57:41.208 --> 57:42.333
Wait!

57:51.093 --> 57:53.636
Vamos! Come on!

58:00.227 --> 58:03.062
Keep walking! Come on, you too!
Vamonos!

58:03.772 --> 58:07.900
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Want some candy?

58:07.985 --> 58:09.402
Let's dance!

58:15.367 --> 58:18.953
Come on, get out of the way!
Come on, out!

58:39.641 --> 58:42.602
Come on, move it!

58:42.686 --> 58:46.731
That way! Towards the light!

58:46.815 --> 58:48.900
Come on! Get out!

59:50.545 --> 59:51.796
Oh, God.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:02.348
Jerry.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:35.423
God, not again.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:38.175
Move your ass! Move out the way!

01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:44.682
- Watch out! What's happening?
- lt's a fucking slaughter, Lieutenant.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.978
Hey, Jerry!

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:53.566
Leona! Oh, please. Leona...

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:58.279
- How's she doing?
- Deep shock, but she's alive.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:05.244
l hear fetal heart sounds. She's pregnant.
Let's move. LA County. Stat!

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:12.793
Stand back.
On three. One, two, three. Load up.

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:17.173
Out of my way!
Move out the way! Move it!

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.507
Man!

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:37.735
Wait a minute. Let me see.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:46.202
- Where's Jerry?
- l don't know.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.872
We found his badge.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:52.124
Who got hit this time?

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:57.838
Five gang members, bunch of commuters.
Doesn't make sense.

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:01.425
They were all armed.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.595
- What do you mean?
- lt's the chief.

01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:05.888
Wait here.

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.808
What the hell's going on down there?

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.726
lt's a damn nightmare. Civilians this time.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:12.812
- All killed?
- Yeah. Just like the others.

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:14.814
Damn!

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.030
Jerry!

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:28.804
Holy shit! What the hell is going on here?

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:32.266
Hey, guys, get the camera on!
Get the camera on this right now!

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.810
Get that goddamn thing on film!

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.397
What's going on?

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:49.533
Hey, Harrigan!
More victims! More mutilations!

01:03:49.618 --> 01:03:52.578
- Fuck you!
- Pope!

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.581
Pope? Are you there, Pope?
Pope, what's going on?

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:57.870
- Sir, the cop is back.
- Goddamn.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:07.212
Harrigan! Don't you show up
in the damnedest places.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.797
Come here, Lieutenant.

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:11.717
l got something
you might find interesting.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.135
What is this?

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:17.973
How many times do l have to tell you?
You don't know what you're dealing with.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:22.269
There's your killer. Wonderful, isn't it?

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:27.608
Pheromone signature left by his body.
Scent molecules. Punch up three.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.278
Ten years ago
one of his kind eliminated an

01:06:31.363 --> 01:06:33.822
elite Special Forces crew
in Central America.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:38.118
There were two survivors.
They indicated that, when trapped,

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:40.746
the creature activated
a self-destruct device

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:45.167
that destroyed enough rainforest
to cover 300 city blocks.

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:50.631
Remarkable weaponry. That's right,
Lieutenant. Other-world life forms.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:54.259
A fucking alien!

01:06:56.012 --> 01:07:01.016
lwo Jima, Cambodia, Beirut.
Drawn by heat and conflict.

01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:07.940
He's on safari.
Lions. The tigers. The bears. Oh, my!

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.818
Trophies. That's the game, isn't it, Keyes?

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:15.280
You're the lion. This is his jungle.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:18.575
- So why can't we see him?
- Defensive adaptations are astounding.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:22.496
lt's somehow able to bend light.
Perfect camouflage.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.708
- You admire the son of a bitch.
- Not what he does.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:32.089
For what he is. For what he can give us.
A new era of scientific technology.

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:36.051
l've waited a lifetime for this,
and l'm not going to miss the chance.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.472
We have something
on the pheromone scanners.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:48.939
Target one is on the roof.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:52.526
lt's taken us two weeks
to learn his patterns.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.987
He comes here every two days to feed.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:59.074
- Seems he has a taste for beef.
- l didn't think he was vegetarian.

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:02.035
Well, we've prepared a trap
for this predator.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.998
We are certain that this being
can see in only one spectrum of light -

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.584
- ..infrared.
- lnfrared?

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:12.588
- He hunts by seeing our heat.
- Block the heat and he's blind.

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:15.924
These suits insulate body heat,
making the team invisible.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.343
We've flooded the place
with radioactive dust

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:22.431
and installed powerful
ultraviolet lighting everywhere.

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:26.351
The dust adheres to his body,
making him visible.

01:08:26.436 --> 01:08:30.522
Liquid nitrogen. You're not gonna kill him.
You're gonna freeze him.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.734
- We have to capture him.
- He's moving.

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:35.360
Finally.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:40.449
Grab a seat. Enjoy the show.
This is history.

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:59.843
Capture and isolation is our objective.
Defensive action only on my orders.

01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:05.098
Power up. Lights on. Let's get him!

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:22.157
We're in. Switch to ultraviolet.

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:26.537
- Radio silence. Out.
- Engage ultraviolet units A through J.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:55.065
- What's all this interference?
- Correcting the problem, sir.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.766
They're moving to the second level.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.603
Target's still moving, heading towards
the number two stairwell.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.148
Playing right into it.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:36.500
Wait a minute. lt's stopped.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:08.550
lt's moving back against the wall.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.261
lt's backing up.
lt's moving away from them.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.221
Your boys have been made.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:18.351
- Sir, it's circling around behind them.
- Get 'em out! They're walking into a trap!

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:23.231
Keyes, he's behind you.
Third floor structure. Right there!

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:25.734
Who is this? Clear the line.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:29.946
He sees the damn lights.
Turn 'em off! Shit!

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:31.823
Stop him!

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:41.166
- Door. Open it.
- Go fuck yourself.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:45.087
- OK. OK.
- The door.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:48.757
- Yes, sir.
- You don't know what you're doing.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.426
- lt's open.
- You'll ruin everything!

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.011
Fuck yourself!

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:57.933
Defensive formation one.
Nitrogen guns, safeties off.

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:01.311
Everyone else, rock'n'roll. This is it.

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:18.328
- He's moving down from the right.
- Garber, where is he? l can't see him.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.081
He's right there!

01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:25.377
Goddamn it! Where is he?
Well, give me a coordinate! Where is he?

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:29.756
- Watch out!
- My God.

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:32.717
Watch your crossfire!

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.812
l'm losing my pressure.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.674
Keyes, you all right?

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.718
Keyes, it's over here!

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:32.110
Come on! Switch over! Shit! l can't see!

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:38.617
They're gone.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.620
They're all dead.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:35.924
You want me? Here l am!

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:34.370
You are one

01:20:34.455 --> 01:20:35.830
ugly mother...

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:40.168
Motherfucker!

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.333
Guess who's back.

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:25.213
Too late to go home now.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:43.064
Get out of here, Harrigan.
l'm gonna save your ass.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:45.233
This is between me and him!

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:35.867
God...

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:34.425
Birds.

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.428
Damn birds.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.543
OK, pussyface.

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:52.587
lt's your move.

01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:55.465
Shit happens.

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:36.274
Oh, God.

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:42.488
That's all l need is birds.

01:26:42.573 --> 01:26:44.073
You can do it.

01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:49.912
l can do it.

01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:53.416
lt's like falling off a log.

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:08.806
Like a 30-story log. Damn!

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:29.452
Maybe l'll get lucky and fall.

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:11.869
Damn it.

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.973
The final Jeopardy answer is this:

01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:37.019
Berengaria, who never set foot in England,
was its queen for eight years

01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:42.233
after marrying this king on Cyprus.
Good luck.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.860
Herb?

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:48.572
Herb, wake up!
There's somebody in the bathroom.

01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:17.995
- lt's all right. l'm a cop.
- l don't think he gives a shit.

01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.541
Shit!

01:30:22.626 --> 01:30:24.210
Get back inside!

01:30:32.344 --> 01:30:34.804
Holy Moses. Not again. Shit!

01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:37.723
Son of a bitch.

01:30:39.226 --> 01:30:40.476
Oh, God.

01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:48.776
Why can't this guy stay on the ground?

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:55.032
Come on, come on. Come to Papa.

01:31:01.832 --> 01:31:05.584
Stop! Stop the elevator!

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:06.877
Stop it!

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:38.909
Now where the hell am l?

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:57.595
Where are you?

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:54.985
Jesus Christ.

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:11.246
That's right, asshole!

01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:13.123
Shit happens!

01:36:55.768 --> 01:36:58.395
OK. Who's next?

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:47.236
Take it.

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:53.825
"1 71 5."

01:40:46.499 --> 01:40:50.252
Harrigan!
What the fuck happened in there?

01:40:58.052 --> 01:41:00.345
Goddamn it. We came so close!

01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:14.317
Don't worry, asshole.
You'll get another chance.
