WEBVTT

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:20.588
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:30.802
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

00:01:38.746 --> 00:01:41.510
Go back to the Shadow.

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:46.216
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:54.583
You shall not pass!

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:23.415
No! No!

00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:25.591
Gandalf!

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.928
Fly, you fools.

00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:37.433
No!

00:02:39.405 --> 00:02:41.464
Gandalf!

00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:51.973
Gandalf!

00:03:52.978 --> 00:03:55.207
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

00:03:57.148 --> 00:03:58.877
Nothing.

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:08.216
Just a dream.

00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:22.599
Can you see the bottom?

00:04:23.874 --> 00:04:27.002
No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:39.982
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

00:04:43.094 --> 00:04:45.062
Mr. Frodo!

00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:49.394
I think I've found the bottom.

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:57.797
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

00:04:57.974 --> 00:05:01.205
It's not natural. None of it.

00:05:04.314 --> 00:05:06.373
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:08.809
Just a bit of seasoning.

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.217
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:14.986
Roast chicken?!

00:05:15.592 --> 00:05:16.854
You never know.

00:05:17.327 --> 00:05:20.262
Sam. My dear Sam.

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:25.901
It's very special, that. It's
the best salt in all the Shire.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.161
It is special.

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:34.942
It's a little bit of home.

00:05:38.248 --> 00:05:40.682
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.

00:05:41.184 --> 00:05:44.642
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

00:05:45.488 --> 00:05:49.322
It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that.

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:51.960
Real Elvish rope.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:55.263
Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.

00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:57.399
Won't come free in a hurry.

00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:08.402
Real Elvish rope.

00:06:22.558 --> 00:06:27.052
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.424
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

00:06:30.165 --> 00:06:31.928
It's just where we can't get.

00:06:33.402 --> 00:06:36.337
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

00:06:38.674 --> 00:06:41.438
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

00:06:43.078 --> 00:06:46.377
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:48.716
...but they did.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.762
Mr. Frodo?

00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:08.100
It's the Ring, isn't it?

00:07:09.203 --> 00:07:11.671
It's getting heavier.

00:07:24.318 --> 00:07:27.048
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:29.847
Oh, yes. Lovely.

00:07:30.024 --> 00:07:32.788
Lembas bread. And look!

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.493
More lembas bread.

00:07:48.242 --> 00:07:50.210
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:53.403
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:57.740
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

00:08:03.557 --> 00:08:05.855
Those rain clouds might.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.924
This looks strangely familiar.

00:08:43.496 --> 00:08:46.021
It's because we've been here before.

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:48.759
We're going in circles.

00:08:49.502 --> 00:08:51.367
What is that horrid stink?

00:08:51.538 --> 00:08:53.733
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

00:08:53.907 --> 00:08:55.841
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

00:08:57.877 --> 00:09:00.107
I can smell it.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.784
We're not alone.

00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:23.527
The thieves. The thieves.

00:09:23.702 --> 00:09:27.661
The filthy little thieves.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.501
Where is it?

00:09:30.676 --> 00:09:33.372
Where is it?

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:37.276
They stole it from us.

00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:41.681
My precious.

00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:45.819
Curse them, we hates them!

00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:50.087
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

00:10:45.183 --> 00:10:46.980
This is Sting.

00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:48.675
You've seen it before...

00:10:48.886 --> 00:10:51.354
haven't you, Gollum?

00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:58.918
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

00:11:14.946 --> 00:11:16.708
It burns!

00:11:16.913 --> 00:11:19.211
It burns us!

00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:22.151
It freezes!

00:11:23.954 --> 00:11:26.218
Nasty Elves twisted it.

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:29.051
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

00:11:32.462 --> 00:11:36.728
It's hopeless. Every Orc in
Mordor's going to hear this racket.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.494
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:43.261
That would kill us! Kill us!

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.136
It's no more than you deserve!

00:11:47.844 --> 00:11:49.869
Maybe he does deserve to die.

00:11:52.282 --> 00:11:55.718
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

00:11:59.189 --> 00:12:04.024
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:07.025
Take it off us.

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:14.069
We swears to do what you wants.

00:12:14.237 --> 00:12:16.171
We swears.

00:12:16.473 --> 00:12:18.907
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.339
We swears...

00:12:23.612 --> 00:12:28.345
to serve the master of the precious.

00:12:29.985 --> 00:12:32.317
We will swear on...

00:12:32.488 --> 00:12:34.456
on the precious.

00:12:34.623 --> 00:12:36.818
Gollum. Gollum.

00:12:36.992 --> 00:12:41.122
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

00:12:41.964 --> 00:12:43.295
Yes...

00:12:43.866 --> 00:12:46.357
on the precious.

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:51.171
On the precious.

00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:53.831
I don't believe you!

00:12:55.878 --> 00:12:59.336
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

00:12:59.582 --> 00:13:01.277
He's trying to trick us.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.442
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

00:13:15.864 --> 00:13:20.392
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:25.067
You've been there before?

00:13:26.074 --> 00:13:27.666
Yes.

00:13:38.586 --> 00:13:41.214
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

00:13:49.797 --> 00:13:53.665
To the Gate, to the Gate! To
the Gate, the master says. Yes!

00:13:53.835 --> 00:13:58.636
No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him.

00:13:58.806 --> 00:14:03.038
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

00:14:03.244 --> 00:14:06.680
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.

00:14:06.881 --> 00:14:12.842
No. Ashes and dust and thirst
there is, and pits, pits, pits.

00:14:13.021 --> 00:14:15.888
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

00:14:16.057 --> 00:14:21.188
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.

00:14:24.165 --> 00:14:27.964
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.600
There! What did I tell you?

00:14:32.773 --> 00:14:35.003
He's run off, the old villain.

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:37.699
So much for his promises.

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:39.469
This way, Hobbits.

00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:41.771
Follow me!

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:57.028
Merry!

00:14:57.998 --> 00:14:59.488
Merry!

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:08.771
You're late. Our master grows impatient.

00:15:08.975 --> 00:15:10.772
He wants the Shire-rats now.

00:15:11.645 --> 00:15:16.241
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:20.344
Saruman will have his prize.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.717
We will deliver them.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.294
Merry!

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.794
Merry? Wake up.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:39.134
My friend is sick.

00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:42.234
He needs water. Please!

00:15:43.008 --> 00:15:46.944
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.843
Stop it!

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:56.681
Can't take his draught!

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:01.918
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.827
You want some?

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:08.931
Then keep your mouth shut.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:14.363
Merry.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:16.764
Hello, Pip.

00:16:18.611 --> 00:16:21.045
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:23.704
- It was just an act.
- An act?

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:27.250
See? I fooled you too.

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.684
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

00:16:33.992 --> 00:16:35.983
What is it? What do you smell?

00:16:36.961 --> 00:16:38.258
Man-flesh.

00:16:40.398 --> 00:16:42.764
They've picked up our trail.

00:16:43.868 --> 00:16:44.994
Aragorn.

00:16:46.704 --> 00:16:48.535
Let's move!

00:17:12.096 --> 00:17:14.621
Their pace has quickened.

00:17:15.633 --> 00:17:17.601
They must have caught our scent.

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:19.532
Hurry!

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:24.937
Come on, Gimli!

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.078
Three days and nights pursuit.

00:17:31.249 --> 00:17:34.218
No food. No rest.

00:17:34.385 --> 00:17:38.377
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.

00:18:09.786 --> 00:18:12.983
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

00:18:14.324 --> 00:18:16.690
They may yet be alive.

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:20.156
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

00:18:22.766 --> 00:18:25.257
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:29.735
I'm wasted on cross-country. We
Dwarves are natural sprinters.

00:18:30.274 --> 00:18:33.539
Very dangerous over short distances.

00:18:45.288 --> 00:18:47.017
Rohan.

00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:49.987
Home of the Horse-lords.

00:18:51.193 --> 00:18:53.753
There's something strange at work here.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.899
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

00:18:57.066 --> 00:19:00.035
Sets its will against us.

00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:08.108
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

00:19:08.277 --> 00:19:10.837
The Uruks turn northeast.

00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:13.842
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

00:19:14.717 --> 00:19:15.979
Saruman.

00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:27.590
The world is changing.

00:19:27.763 --> 00:19:33.360
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.800
and Mordor?

00:19:38.507 --> 00:19:44.138
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...

00:19:44.312 --> 00:19:47.941
and the union of the two towers?

00:19:54.456 --> 00:19:57.425
Together, my Lord Sauron...

00:19:57.592 --> 00:20:01.119
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

00:20:17.212 --> 00:20:21.478
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.315
The forests will fall.

00:20:27.222 --> 00:20:30.089
A new order will rise.

00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:36.062
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

00:20:36.231 --> 00:20:40.190
and the iron fists of the Orc.

00:20:52.713 --> 00:20:55.944
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!

00:20:56.116 --> 00:20:57.743
But, my lord, there are too many!

00:20:57.918 --> 00:21:00.944
They cannot all be armed in
time, we don't have the means.

00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:04.181
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:07.191
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.

00:21:08.562 --> 00:21:12.828
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

00:21:14.268 --> 00:21:16.600
- Burn it.
- Yes.

00:21:17.337 --> 00:21:19.635
We will fight for you.

00:21:19.807 --> 00:21:21.775
Swear it.

00:21:32.286 --> 00:21:37.053
We will die for Saruman.

00:21:38.158 --> 00:21:40.149
The Horse-Men took your lands.

00:21:40.327 --> 00:21:44.855
They drove your people into the
hills to scratch a living off rocks.

00:21:45.032 --> 00:21:46.465
Murderers!

00:21:47.401 --> 00:21:49.493
Take back the lands they stole from you.

00:21:49.702 --> 00:21:51.465
Burn every village!

00:21:54.707 --> 00:21:59.838
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:02.838
It will begin in Rohan.

00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:07.110
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

00:22:07.286 --> 00:22:09.083
But no more.

00:22:09.255 --> 00:22:11.519
Eothain! Eothain!

00:22:13.693 --> 00:22:16.355
You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.

00:22:16.729 --> 00:22:19.391
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

00:22:19.565 --> 00:22:21.226
He is too big for him.

00:22:21.434 --> 00:22:24.403
Listen to me. You must ride
to Edoras and raise the alarm.

00:22:24.604 --> 00:22:27.095
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

00:22:27.406 --> 00:22:30.307
I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.

00:22:30.476 --> 00:22:34.207
Freda, I will find you there.

00:22:39.118 --> 00:22:40.813
Quickly!

00:22:47.226 --> 00:22:48.784
Go, child.

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:03.573
Rohan, my lord...

00:23:04.042 --> 00:23:06.772
is ready to fall.

00:23:18.023 --> 00:23:19.547
Theodred.

00:23:19.758 --> 00:23:21.385
Find the king's son!

00:23:37.843 --> 00:23:43.873
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

00:23:44.783 --> 00:23:47.616
My Lord Eomer, over here!

00:23:56.427 --> 00:23:58.224
He's alive.

00:24:29.026 --> 00:24:31.119
Theodred.

00:24:44.508 --> 00:24:47.534
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:50.436
He was ambushed by Orcs.

00:24:51.982 --> 00:24:55.611
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

00:24:55.986 --> 00:24:58.476
That is a lie.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:05.491
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

00:25:07.163 --> 00:25:09.154
Grima.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.534
Grima.

00:25:15.071 --> 00:25:16.561
Grima.

00:25:17.373 --> 00:25:20.433
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

00:25:20.843 --> 00:25:24.438
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

00:25:25.114 --> 00:25:28.015
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

00:25:35.858 --> 00:25:41.626
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

00:25:41.831 --> 00:25:44.299
Can you not see?

00:25:44.467 --> 00:25:49.495
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

00:25:49.706 --> 00:25:52.231
your warmongering.

00:25:54.444 --> 00:25:56.412
Warmongering?

00:25:56.579 --> 00:25:58.740
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

00:25:59.582 --> 00:26:01.947
What was the promised price, Grima?

00:26:02.184 --> 00:26:05.779
When all the Men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:20.894
Too long have you watched my sister.

00:26:21.103 --> 00:26:23.071
Too long have you haunted her steps.

00:26:31.146 --> 00:26:35.480
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:36.810
Too much.

00:26:39.154 --> 00:26:43.955
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...

00:26:44.126 --> 00:26:48.927
and all its domains under pain of death.

00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:51.730
You have no authority here.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.368
Your orders mean nothing.

00:26:54.903 --> 00:26:58.737
This order does not come from me.

00:26:58.907 --> 00:27:01.068
It comes from the king.

00:27:01.676 --> 00:27:04.269
He signed it this morning.

00:27:35.843 --> 00:27:38.539
Keep breathing. That's the key.

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:40.474
Breathe.

00:27:44.585 --> 00:27:48.419
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

00:28:04.572 --> 00:28:06.597
We're not going no further...

00:28:06.774 --> 00:28:08.764
until we've had a breather.

00:28:09.309 --> 00:28:11.277
Get a fire going!

00:28:15.348 --> 00:28:16.906
Merry!

00:28:17.283 --> 00:28:18.614
Merry!

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.519
I think we might have made a
mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

00:28:35.001 --> 00:28:37.196
What's making that noise?

00:28:38.771 --> 00:28:40.238
It's the trees.

00:28:40.974 --> 00:28:42.032
What?

00:28:42.375 --> 00:28:46.209
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

00:28:46.379 --> 00:28:50.873
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.574
and come alive.

00:28:52.819 --> 00:28:54.514
Alive?

00:28:55.388 --> 00:28:57.083
Trees that could whisper...

00:28:58.091 --> 00:29:00.559
talk to each other...

00:29:00.727 --> 00:29:02.524
even move.

00:29:04.164 --> 00:29:06.394
I'm starving.

00:29:06.566 --> 00:29:10.626
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

00:29:11.003 --> 00:29:12.265
Yeah!

00:29:12.471 --> 00:29:15.736
Why can't we have some meat?!

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.305
What about them?

00:29:20.479 --> 00:29:22.379
They're fresh.

00:29:23.048 --> 00:29:26.814
They are not for eating.

00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:34.759
What about their legs?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.258
They don't need those.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.927
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

00:29:43.735 --> 00:29:48.638
The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.

00:29:49.007 --> 00:29:50.941
Alive?

00:29:53.912 --> 00:29:58.178
Why alive? Do they give good sport?

00:30:00.586 --> 00:30:03.953
They have something. An Elvish weapon.

00:30:04.122 --> 00:30:07.148
The master wants it for the war.

00:30:10.062 --> 00:30:11.927
They think we have the Ring.

00:30:12.097 --> 00:30:14.530
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.368
Just a mouthful...

00:30:18.536 --> 00:30:19.730
a bit of the flank.

00:30:26.544 --> 00:30:30.105
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:37.983
Pippin.

00:30:38.155 --> 00:30:39.850
Let's go.

00:30:48.299 --> 00:30:49.789
Go on.

00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:51.468
Call for help.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:53.962
Squeal.

00:30:54.171 --> 00:30:57.334
No one's going to save you now.

00:31:06.517 --> 00:31:07.916
Pippin!

00:31:32.208 --> 00:31:34.699
A red sun rises.

00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:38.146
Blood has been spilled this night.

00:32:09.312 --> 00:32:11.177
Riders of Rohan...

00:32:11.614 --> 00:32:14.048
what news from the Mark?

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:46.213
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

00:32:47.015 --> 00:32:48.277
Speak quickly!

00:32:48.617 --> 00:32:53.281
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

00:33:02.431 --> 00:33:04.956
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.767
if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

00:33:08.804 --> 00:33:10.863
You would die before your stroke fell.

00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:21.481
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

00:33:21.817 --> 00:33:26.014
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and
Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

00:33:26.187 --> 00:33:29.418
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

00:33:31.159 --> 00:33:34.925
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:37.358
Not even his own kin.

00:33:41.869 --> 00:33:43.837
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

00:33:44.005 --> 00:33:45.939
and claimed lordship over these lands.

00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:50.901
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

00:33:51.078 --> 00:33:52.841
And for that, we are banished.

00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:58.215
The White Wizard is cunning.

00:33:58.886 --> 00:34:01.286
He walks here and there, they say...

00:34:01.489 --> 00:34:03.423
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:09.125
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:11.527
We are no spies.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.634
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:17.268
They have taken two of our friends captive.

00:34:18.072 --> 00:34:20.540
The Uruks are destroyed. We
slaughtered them during the night.

00:34:20.708 --> 00:34:23.871
But there were two Hobbits. Did
you see two Hobbits with them?

00:34:24.045 --> 00:34:27.013
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.341
We left none alive.

00:34:32.986 --> 00:34:35.955
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

00:34:41.428 --> 00:34:42.656
Dead?

00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:47.360
I am sorry.

00:34:52.939 --> 00:34:55.237
Hasufel! Arod!

00:34:57.043 --> 00:35:01.707
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

00:35:02.916 --> 00:35:04.508
Farewell.

00:35:09.723 --> 00:35:11.953
Look for your friends.

00:35:12.425 --> 00:35:14.655
But do not trust to hope.

00:35:16.363 --> 00:35:18.923
It has forsaken these lands.

00:35:19.132 --> 00:35:21.123
We ride north!

00:36:11.717 --> 00:36:13.548
It's one of their wee belts.

00:36:27.366 --> 00:36:29.391
We failed them.

00:36:43.448 --> 00:36:45.609
A Hobbit lay here.

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:49.145
And the other.

00:36:59.964 --> 00:37:01.556
They crawled.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.763
Their hands were bound.

00:37:19.917 --> 00:37:21.748
Their bonds were cut.

00:37:37.234 --> 00:37:39.361
They ran over here.

00:37:43.006 --> 00:37:44.200
They were followed.

00:37:47.411 --> 00:37:49.140
The belt!

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.176
Run!

00:37:57.921 --> 00:37:59.252
Tracks lead away from the battle...

00:38:04.061 --> 00:38:06.154
into Fangorn Forest.

00:38:07.064 --> 00:38:08.497
Fangorn?

00:38:08.665 --> 00:38:11.293
What madness drove them in there?

00:38:29.052 --> 00:38:32.044
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

00:38:38.761 --> 00:38:42.197
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

00:38:48.437 --> 00:38:49.426
Come here!

00:38:54.944 --> 00:38:57.504
Trees. Climb a tree.

00:39:06.822 --> 00:39:08.551
He's gone.

00:39:20.636 --> 00:39:22.968
Merry!

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:38.853
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.518
Run, Merry!

00:39:57.305 --> 00:40:01.639
Little Orcs.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.142
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

00:40:04.312 --> 00:40:06.212
Tree?

00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:09.373
I am no tree!

00:40:09.617 --> 00:40:11.778
I am an Ent.

00:40:12.353 --> 00:40:14.480
A tree-herder.

00:40:15.056 --> 00:40:17.024
A shepherd of the forest.

00:40:17.192 --> 00:40:18.557
Don't talk to it, Merry.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.527
Don't encourage it!

00:40:20.728 --> 00:40:24.960
Treebeard, some call me.

00:40:25.133 --> 00:40:27.101
And whose side are you on?

00:40:27.702 --> 00:40:29.329
Side?

00:40:29.537 --> 00:40:32.404
I am on nobody's side...

00:40:32.774 --> 00:40:38.110
because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

00:40:38.913 --> 00:40:43.543
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

00:40:43.952 --> 00:40:46.351
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.818
Hobbits?

00:40:50.057 --> 00:40:54.926
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

00:40:56.129 --> 00:41:00.623
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:02.928
They come with fire.

00:41:03.136 --> 00:41:05.696
They come with axes.

00:41:05.906 --> 00:41:10.707
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

00:41:10.911 --> 00:41:14.711
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

00:41:14.948 --> 00:41:17.781
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

00:41:17.985 --> 00:41:19.782
Halflings!

00:41:19.953 --> 00:41:21.045
Shire-folk!

00:41:21.255 --> 00:41:23.587
Maybe you are...

00:41:23.891 --> 00:41:27.520
and maybe you aren't.

00:41:28.629 --> 00:41:32.531
The White Wizard will know.

00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:35.267
The White Wizard?

00:41:36.803 --> 00:41:38.293
Saruman.

00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:52.544
See? See?

00:41:52.785 --> 00:41:55.185
We've led you out.

00:41:55.354 --> 00:41:57.845
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.428
Very lucky we find you.

00:42:10.102 --> 00:42:11.831
Nice Hobbit.

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:18.005
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

00:42:18.177 --> 00:42:20.805
A swamp, yes, yes.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:26.279
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

00:42:28.621 --> 00:42:32.057
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

00:42:35.328 --> 00:42:37.956
I found it. I did.

00:42:38.164 --> 00:42:40.826
The way through the marshes.

00:42:41.033 --> 00:42:44.525
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

00:42:44.737 --> 00:42:48.798
They go around for miles and miles.

00:42:49.008 --> 00:42:50.441
Come quickly.

00:42:50.643 --> 00:42:54.703
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.213
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

00:42:59.384 --> 00:43:01.648
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.187
No, no birdses to eat.

00:43:05.423 --> 00:43:09.655
No crunchable birdses.

00:43:10.261 --> 00:43:13.128
We are famished! Yes!

00:43:13.298 --> 00:43:17.598
Famished we are, precious!

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.074
Here.

00:43:35.286 --> 00:43:37.277
What does it eats?

00:43:37.489 --> 00:43:39.457
Is it tasty?

00:43:44.763 --> 00:43:47.357
It tries to chokes us!

00:43:47.632 --> 00:43:51.295
We can't eats Hobbit food!

00:43:53.004 --> 00:43:57.030
We must starve!

00:43:57.207 --> 00:43:59.573
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

00:44:00.344 --> 00:44:02.539
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

00:44:02.746 --> 00:44:05.579
It does not care if we be hungry.

00:44:05.816 --> 00:44:10.549
Does not care if we should die.

00:44:11.188 --> 00:44:14.021
Not like master.

00:44:15.392 --> 00:44:17.485
Master cares.

00:44:18.662 --> 00:44:20.527
Master knows.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.968
Yes.

00:44:25.135 --> 00:44:27.763
Precious.

00:44:31.341 --> 00:44:34.970
Once it takes hold of us...

00:44:36.847 --> 00:44:41.011
it never lets go.

00:44:41.718 --> 00:44:42.878
Don't touch me!

00:45:15.351 --> 00:45:17.216
There are dead things!

00:45:17.386 --> 00:45:19.149
Dead faces in the water.

00:45:23.993 --> 00:45:27.952
All dead. All rotten.

00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:32.230
Elves and Men and Orcses.

00:45:32.435 --> 00:45:36.064
A great battle long ago.

00:45:36.873 --> 00:45:38.602
Dead Marshes.

00:45:38.808 --> 00:45:41.538
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

00:45:43.246 --> 00:45:44.975
This way.

00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:47.945
Don't follow the lights.

00:45:49.685 --> 00:45:53.553
Careful now! Or Hobbits go
down to join the dead ones...

00:45:53.756 --> 00:45:57.852
and light little candles of their own.

00:46:24.052 --> 00:46:25.519
Frodo!

00:47:09.997 --> 00:47:14.661
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

00:47:14.835 --> 00:47:16.700
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.735
Are you all right?

00:47:47.635 --> 00:47:50.604
So bright.

00:47:50.804 --> 00:47:54.604
So beautiful.

00:47:54.775 --> 00:47:58.643
Our precious.

00:48:00.114 --> 00:48:01.604
What did you say?

00:48:01.815 --> 00:48:03.976
Master should be resting.

00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:08.211
Master needs to keep up his strength.

00:48:10.189 --> 00:48:13.454
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

00:48:13.626 --> 00:48:15.116
Gollum. Gollum.

00:48:15.295 --> 00:48:17.092
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

00:48:17.263 --> 00:48:21.359
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

00:48:21.534 --> 00:48:23.092
He said your life was a sad story.

00:48:23.303 --> 00:48:27.831
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

00:48:28.007 --> 00:48:30.999
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:32.939
Were you?

00:48:35.181 --> 00:48:37.411
Smeagol.

00:48:42.121 --> 00:48:44.646
What did you call me?

00:48:45.992 --> 00:48:48.756
That was your name once, wasn't it?

00:48:49.329 --> 00:48:51.695
A long time ago.

00:48:52.532 --> 00:48:54.693
My name.

00:48:55.768 --> 00:48:57.258
My name.

00:49:04.143 --> 00:49:06.611
Smeagol.

00:49:10.749 --> 00:49:12.376
Black Riders!

00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:13.882
Hide! Hide!

00:49:24.463 --> 00:49:26.761
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

00:49:26.932 --> 00:49:30.561
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

00:49:31.336 --> 00:49:33.998
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

00:49:34.172 --> 00:49:37.141
No, you cannot kill them. No.

00:50:04.302 --> 00:50:05.394
Wraiths!

00:50:05.604 --> 00:50:07.799
Wraiths on wings!

00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:17.838
They are calling for it.

00:50:18.082 --> 00:50:21.609
They are calling for the precious.

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.881
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.318
I'm here.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.864
Hurry, Hobbits.

00:50:45.443 --> 00:50:49.379
The Black Gate is very close.

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:58.118
Orc blood.

00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:09.828
These are strange tracks.

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:13.126
The air is so close in here.

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.704
This forest is old.

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:19.498
Very old.

00:51:21.277 --> 00:51:23.575
Full of memory...

00:51:26.182 --> 00:51:28.514
and anger.

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:37.592
The trees are speaking to each other.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.250
Gimli!

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:41.363
Lower your ax.

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:46.931
They have feelings, my friend.

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:49.461
The Elves began it.

00:51:49.672 --> 00:51:54.405
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:57.277
Talking trees.

00:51:57.914 --> 00:52:00.940
What do trees have to talk about?

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:04.280
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.250
Something's out there.

00:52:16.035 --> 00:52:17.859
What do you see?

00:52:18.234 --> 00:52:20.667
The White Wizard approaches.

00:52:26.875 --> 00:52:31.175
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.

00:52:40.756 --> 00:52:43.020
We must be quick.

00:52:58.607 --> 00:53:02.236
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

00:53:02.811 --> 00:53:04.210
Where are they?

00:53:04.379 --> 00:53:07.940
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

00:53:08.116 --> 00:53:12.382
They met someone they did not expect.

00:53:12.554 --> 00:53:14.681
Does that comfort you?

00:53:14.856 --> 00:53:16.824
Who are you?

00:53:18.293 --> 00:53:20.261
Show yourself!

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.161
It cannot be.

00:53:34.141 --> 00:53:35.108
Forgive me.

00:53:36.777 --> 00:53:38.711
I mistook you for Saruman.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.244
I am Saruman.

00:53:43.784 --> 00:53:47.652
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

00:53:48.623 --> 00:53:50.113
You fell.

00:53:51.592 --> 00:53:54.117
Through fire...

00:53:54.295 --> 00:53:55.592
and water.

00:53:57.064 --> 00:53:59.589
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

00:53:59.767 --> 00:54:03.464
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.050
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

00:54:22.223 --> 00:54:26.682
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

00:54:32.699 --> 00:54:35.259
Darkness took me...

00:54:36.036 --> 00:54:40.097
and I strayed out of thought and time.

00:54:40.874 --> 00:54:43.934
Stars wheeled overhead...

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:48.704
and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:52.977
But it was not the end.

00:54:53.219 --> 00:54:56.052
I felt life in me again.

00:54:57.991 --> 00:55:00.516
I've been sent back...

00:55:00.694 --> 00:55:02.252
until my task is done.

00:55:02.629 --> 00:55:04.529
Gandalf.

00:55:05.198 --> 00:55:07.189
Gandalf?

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.397
Yes.

00:55:12.205 --> 00:55:14.002
That was what they used to call me.

00:55:16.876 --> 00:55:19.140
Gandalf the Grey.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.243
That was my name.

00:55:22.415 --> 00:55:23.848
Gandalf.

00:55:25.819 --> 00:55:27.878
I am Gandalf the White.

00:55:30.923 --> 00:55:33.983
And I come back to you now...

00:55:34.159 --> 00:55:36.650
at the turn of the tide.

00:55:37.763 --> 00:55:40.732
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.663
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

00:55:45.604 --> 00:55:47.629
That is no short distance!

00:55:47.906 --> 00:55:51.137
We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:53.403
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:57.015
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

00:55:57.182 --> 00:55:59.173
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

00:55:59.351 --> 00:56:03.515
in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

00:56:06.125 --> 00:56:09.288
I mean, charming...

00:56:09.461 --> 00:56:12.191
quite charming forest.

00:56:12.731 --> 00:56:16.394
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

00:56:16.602 --> 00:56:20.971
A great power has been sleeping
here for many long years.

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.576
The coming of Merry and Pippin will
be like the falling of small stones...

00:56:24.743 --> 00:56:28.076
that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

00:56:28.247 --> 00:56:31.239
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.

00:56:31.416 --> 00:56:35.010
You still speak in riddles.

00:56:37.855 --> 00:56:44.260
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days.

00:56:44.428 --> 00:56:48.057
The Ents are going to wake up...

00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:53.093
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

00:56:53.905 --> 00:56:55.031
Oh, that's good.

00:56:55.239 --> 00:56:57.935
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

00:56:59.043 --> 00:57:01.273
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

00:57:01.445 --> 00:57:05.040
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.

00:57:05.216 --> 00:57:08.947
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

00:57:31.242 --> 00:57:32.675
That is one of the Mearas...

00:57:32.844 --> 00:57:35.641
unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

00:57:53.263 --> 00:57:55.527
Shadowfax.

00:57:58.101 --> 00:58:00.729
He is the lord of all horses...

00:58:02.372 --> 00:58:06.240
and has been my friend through many dangers.

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:24.085
O rowan mine

00:58:24.261 --> 00:58:28.061
I saw you shine

00:58:28.231 --> 00:58:31.758
Upon a summer's day

00:58:32.869 --> 00:58:37.329
Upon your head How golden-red

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:42.272
The crown you bore aloft

00:58:42.444 --> 00:58:44.844
Such a beautiful verse.

00:58:45.014 --> 00:58:49.917
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

00:58:50.085 --> 00:58:53.350
You might call it far, perhaps.

00:58:54.256 --> 00:58:58.056
My home lies deep in the forest...

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:02.162
near the roots of the mountain.

00:59:03.432 --> 00:59:07.095
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

00:59:07.336 --> 00:59:11.295
And safe is where I'll keep you.

00:59:11.573 --> 00:59:15.942
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

00:59:16.345 --> 00:59:19.337
It's one of my own compositions.

00:59:19.515 --> 00:59:20.709
Right.

00:59:20.883 --> 00:59:27.015
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:32.058
And the dreams of trees unfold

00:59:32.227 --> 00:59:38.689
When woodland halls are green and cool

00:59:38.901 --> 00:59:42.961
And the wind is in the West

00:59:43.438 --> 00:59:46.100
Come back to me

00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:51.101
Come back to me

00:59:51.279 --> 00:59:57.707
And say my land is best

01:00:05.159 --> 01:00:08.822
Sleep, little Shirelings.

01:00:08.997 --> 01:00:12.592
Heed no nightly noise.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.702
Sleep till morning light.

01:00:18.339 --> 01:00:22.503
I have business in the forest.

01:00:22.677 --> 01:00:28.206
There are many to call. Many that must come.

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:34.114
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

01:00:34.288 --> 01:00:40.124
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

01:00:49.569 --> 01:00:53.835
The veiling shadow that
glowers in the east takes shape.

01:00:54.641 --> 01:00:57.235
Sauron will suffer no rival.

01:00:57.677 --> 01:01:01.943
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

01:01:02.115 --> 01:01:05.482
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.488
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

01:01:08.655 --> 01:01:11.215
The rumor has reached him.

01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:14.360
The heir of Numenor still lives.

01:01:15.328 --> 01:01:18.161
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

01:01:19.499 --> 01:01:21.660
He fears what you may become.

01:01:22.936 --> 01:01:26.372
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.169
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.

01:01:30.343 --> 01:01:31.833
War is coming.

01:01:32.012 --> 01:01:35.573
Rohan must defend itself, and
therein lies our first challenge...

01:01:35.749 --> 01:01:38.183
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

01:01:38.351 --> 01:01:42.048
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

01:01:42.222 --> 01:01:45.316
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

01:01:45.492 --> 01:01:50.190
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:53.157
But for all their cunning...

01:01:53.365 --> 01:01:55.890
we have one advantage.

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.630
The Ring remains hidden.

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:03.574
And that we should seek to destroy it...

01:02:03.742 --> 01:02:06.711
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

01:02:07.313 --> 01:02:10.612
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

01:02:10.783 --> 01:02:12.273
in the hands of a Hobbit.

01:02:12.451 --> 01:02:16.547
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.

01:02:16.722 --> 01:02:19.350
We must trust now in Frodo.

01:02:19.525 --> 01:02:21.356
Everything depends upon speed...

01:02:21.527 --> 01:02:24.519
and the secrecy of his quest.

01:02:26.499 --> 01:02:29.832
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:33.467
Frodo must finish this task alone.

01:02:34.206 --> 01:02:36.538
He's not alone.

01:02:36.709 --> 01:02:38.404
Sam went with him.

01:02:39.078 --> 01:02:40.272
Did he?

01:02:40.446 --> 01:02:45.076
Did he, indeed? Good.

01:02:45.684 --> 01:02:48.118
Yes, very good.

01:02:56.127 --> 01:03:01.030
The Black Gate of Mordor.

01:03:03.768 --> 01:03:06.236
Oh, save us.

01:03:12.043 --> 01:03:15.274
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.

01:03:17.515 --> 01:03:21.975
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:25.589
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

01:03:25.757 --> 01:03:26.985
I did.

01:03:35.767 --> 01:03:37.758
That's it, then.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.634
We can't get past that.

01:04:25.816 --> 01:04:27.147
Look!

01:04:27.317 --> 01:04:28.784
The gate.

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.146
It's opening!

01:04:37.594 --> 01:04:39.562
I can see a way down.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:42.390
Sam, no!

01:04:44.601 --> 01:04:45.966
Master!

01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:13.278
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

01:06:14.055 --> 01:06:17.218
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

01:06:17.659 --> 01:06:19.524
- Now!
- No!

01:06:20.095 --> 01:06:22.063
No! No, master!

01:06:22.263 --> 01:06:25.232
They catch you! They catch you!

01:06:26.534 --> 01:06:29.094
Don't take it to him.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.770
He wants the precious.

01:06:34.943 --> 01:06:37.969
Always he is looking for it.

01:06:38.146 --> 01:06:42.048
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

01:06:42.283 --> 01:06:46.185
But we mustn't let him have it.

01:06:52.594 --> 01:06:54.687
No! There's another way.

01:06:54.896 --> 01:06:57.558
More secret. A dark way.

01:06:57.866 --> 01:07:01.529
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

01:07:02.003 --> 01:07:03.026
He's up to something.

01:07:03.637 --> 01:07:06.231
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

01:07:06.407 --> 01:07:09.137
Yes. There's a path...

01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:11.800
and some stairs.

01:07:12.012 --> 01:07:13.673
And then...

01:07:13.847 --> 01:07:17.180
a tunnel.

01:07:31.198 --> 01:07:32.995
He's led us this far, Sam.

01:07:33.167 --> 01:07:34.566
Mr. Frodo, no.

01:07:35.702 --> 01:07:37.169
He's been true to his word.

01:07:42.042 --> 01:07:43.236
No.

01:07:45.379 --> 01:07:47.006
Lead the way, Smeagol.

01:07:47.614 --> 01:07:51.550
Good Smeagol always helps.

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:26.507
Hello?

01:08:28.921 --> 01:08:30.980
Treebeard?

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:33.022
Where has he gone?

01:08:33.226 --> 01:08:35.660
I had the loveliest dream last night.

01:08:36.295 --> 01:08:38.991
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

01:08:39.165 --> 01:08:41.656
And we smoked all of it. And then...

01:08:42.168 --> 01:08:44.102
you were sick.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:48.538
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

01:08:52.044 --> 01:08:53.978
Did you hear that?

01:09:01.053 --> 01:09:02.452
There it is again.

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:07.985
Something's not right here. Not right at all.

01:09:11.796 --> 01:09:14.731
You just said something... Treeish.

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:18.893
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:28.309
You're taller.

01:09:28.847 --> 01:09:30.337
- Who?
- You!

01:09:30.515 --> 01:09:32.142
- Than what?
- Than me!

01:09:32.651 --> 01:09:34.778
I've always been taller than you.

01:09:34.953 --> 01:09:39.583
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the
tall one. You're the short one.

01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:41.948
Please, Merry.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.994
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

01:09:46.565 --> 01:09:49.398
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

01:09:51.536 --> 01:09:53.800
3'8"!

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:57.571
Three-foot-eight.

01:10:00.645 --> 01:10:02.545
You did something.

01:10:08.353 --> 01:10:09.945
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

01:10:10.889 --> 01:10:12.355
Merry!

01:10:12.556 --> 01:10:14.888
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.

01:10:15.059 --> 01:10:18.961
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

01:10:19.129 --> 01:10:21.290
Give me it back. Merry!

01:10:23.133 --> 01:10:24.498
What's happening?!

01:10:25.369 --> 01:10:26.836
It's got my leg!

01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:28.661
Merry!

01:10:48.058 --> 01:10:49.650
Help!

01:10:56.433 --> 01:10:58.298
Away with you.

01:10:58.469 --> 01:11:00.266
You should not be waking.

01:11:00.771 --> 01:11:05.640
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

01:11:06.243 --> 01:11:08.803
Go to sleep.

01:11:09.146 --> 01:11:11.011
Away with you.

01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:14.480
Come, the forest is waking up.

01:11:15.052 --> 01:11:16.985
It isn't safe.

01:11:19.656 --> 01:11:23.592
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.752
Anger festers in their hearts.

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:29.257
Black are their thoughts.

01:11:29.432 --> 01:11:31.957
Strong is their hate.

01:11:32.135 --> 01:11:34.899
They will harm you if they can.

01:11:35.071 --> 01:11:38.632
There are too few of us now.

01:11:38.808 --> 01:11:42.801
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

01:11:43.446 --> 01:11:46.074
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

01:11:46.249 --> 01:11:49.446
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

01:11:49.619 --> 01:11:55.251
There have been no Entings for
a terrible long count of years.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:12:00.691
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

01:12:00.963 --> 01:12:02.362
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:02.465 --> 01:12:06.401
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

01:12:06.569 --> 01:12:09.800
We lost them.

01:12:09.972 --> 01:12:15.035
And now we cannot find them.

01:12:15.211 --> 01:12:21.445
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:24.398
Can't say that I have.

01:12:24.942 --> 01:12:26.967
You, Pip?

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:30.845
What do they look like?

01:12:33.283 --> 01:12:37.947
I don't remember now.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:58.273
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.670
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:05.246
whose mind is overthrown.

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:09.681
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.483
My lord, your son...

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:15.852
he is dead.

01:13:17.361 --> 01:13:19.158
My lord?

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.590
Uncle?

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.668
Will you not go to him?

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:36.209
Will you do nothing?

01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:38.347
Be careful what you say.

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:40.708
Do not look for welcome here.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.904
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.238
What a tragedy for the king...

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.449
to lose his only son and heir.

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:20.079
I understand. His passing is hard to accept.

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:25.158
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

01:14:25.326 --> 01:14:26.793
Leave me alone, snake!

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.890
Oh, but you are alone.

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:36.300
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:39.929
in the bitter watches of the night...

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:43.771
when all your life seems to shrink.

01:14:43.978 --> 01:14:48.176
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:52.911
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

01:14:55.156 --> 01:14:57.056
So fair.

01:14:58.326 --> 01:14:59.691
So cold.

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.624
Like a morning of pale spring...

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:07.268
still clinging to winter's chill.

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:23.540
Your words are poison.

01:16:56.108 --> 01:16:58.576
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

01:17:12.925 --> 01:17:16.725
I cannot allow you before Theoden
King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:20.791
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:39.912
Your staff.

01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:46.813
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:08.477
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

01:18:16.788 --> 01:18:18.346
He's a herald of woe.

01:18:18.523 --> 01:18:22.960
The courtesy of your hall is
somewhat lessened of late...

01:18:24.062 --> 01:18:25.495
Theoden King.

01:18:26.197 --> 01:18:28.722
He's not welcome.

01:18:29.668 --> 01:18:35.004
Why should I welcome you...

01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:39.169
Gandalf Stormcrow?

01:18:39.343 --> 01:18:42.642
A just question, my liege.

01:18:42.813 --> 01:18:45.680
Late is the hour...

01:18:45.849 --> 01:18:49.808
in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

01:18:50.621 --> 01:18:52.680
Lathspell I name him.

01:18:52.856 --> 01:18:55.757
Ill news is an ill guest.

01:18:55.926 --> 01:19:00.488
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

01:19:00.664 --> 01:19:02.598
I have not passed through fire and death...

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.931
to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

01:19:06.937 --> 01:19:09.030
His staff.

01:19:09.239 --> 01:19:13.369
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

01:19:16.714 --> 01:19:18.648
Theoden...

01:19:19.216 --> 01:19:21.776
son of Thengel...

01:19:23.554 --> 01:19:25.920
too long have you sat in the Shadows.

01:19:28.892 --> 01:19:32.157
I would stay still if I were you.

01:19:32.329 --> 01:19:34.422
Hearken to me!

01:19:39.937 --> 01:19:42.063
I release you...

01:19:42.271 --> 01:19:44.239
from the spell.

01:19:55.785 --> 01:19:58.811
You have no power here...

01:19:58.988 --> 01:20:02.617
Gandalf the Grey.

01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:13.093
I will draw you, Saruman, as
poison is drawn from a wound.

01:20:22.545 --> 01:20:24.069
Wait.

01:20:25.515 --> 01:20:29.349
If I go, Theoden dies.

01:20:30.052 --> 01:20:32.247
You did not kill me...

01:20:32.422 --> 01:20:34.617
you will not kill him.

01:20:38.528 --> 01:20:40.223
Rohan is mine.

01:20:41.697 --> 01:20:43.028
Be gone.

01:21:27.542 --> 01:21:29.669
I know your face.

01:21:34.249 --> 01:21:35.511
Eowyn.

01:21:37.819 --> 01:21:39.081
Eowyn.

01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:48.555
Gandalf?

01:21:49.096 --> 01:21:51.963
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

01:22:05.312 --> 01:22:07.906
Dark have been my dreams of late.

01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:15.818
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:18.959
if they grasped your sword.

01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:06.038
I've only...

01:23:06.239 --> 01:23:09.299
ever served you, my lord.

01:23:09.475 --> 01:23:14.469
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:17.415
Send me not from your sight.

01:23:19.719 --> 01:23:22.449
No, my lord! No, my lord.

01:23:22.655 --> 01:23:23.849
Let him go.

01:23:24.557 --> 01:23:27.788
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

01:23:36.936 --> 01:23:39.268
Get out of my way!

01:23:41.507 --> 01:23:44.670
Hail, Theoden King!

01:24:09.267 --> 01:24:11.758
Where is Theodred?

01:24:14.806 --> 01:24:17.366
Where is my son?

01:25:44.562 --> 01:25:46.291
Simbelmyn?

01:25:51.469 --> 01:25:55.064
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.

01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:01.877
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

01:26:03.947 --> 01:26:07.815
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

01:26:08.585 --> 01:26:12.988
The young perish and the old linger.

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:15.683
That I should live...

01:26:15.859 --> 01:26:19.226
to see the last days of my house.

01:26:20.497 --> 01:26:24.365
Theodred's death was not of your making.

01:26:27.403 --> 01:26:30.804
No parent should have to bury their child.

01:26:47.524 --> 01:26:49.389
He was strong in life.

01:26:50.493 --> 01:26:54.054
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

01:27:38.674 --> 01:27:40.574
They had no warning.

01:27:40.742 --> 01:27:43.142
They were unarmed.

01:27:43.612 --> 01:27:47.639
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

01:27:48.584 --> 01:27:50.552
Rick, cot and tree.

01:27:50.853 --> 01:27:53.083
Where is Mama?

01:27:53.856 --> 01:27:58.088
This is but a taste of the
terror that Saruman will unleash.

01:27:58.293 --> 01:28:02.627
All the more potent for he is
driven now by fear of Sauron.

01:28:04.233 --> 01:28:07.201
Ride out and meet him head on.

01:28:07.969 --> 01:28:11.461
Draw him away from your women and children.

01:28:11.806 --> 01:28:13.433
You must fight.

01:28:13.608 --> 01:28:17.442
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

01:28:17.612 --> 01:28:19.239
Eomer is loyal to you.

01:28:19.413 --> 01:28:22.109
His men will return and fight for their king.

01:28:22.283 --> 01:28:26.185
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

01:28:29.857 --> 01:28:32.087
Eomer cannot help us.

01:28:32.727 --> 01:28:34.490
I know what it is you want of me...

01:28:34.695 --> 01:28:37.960
but I will not bring further death to my people.

01:28:39.634 --> 01:28:41.329
I will not risk open war.

01:28:43.537 --> 01:28:46.904
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

01:28:51.178 --> 01:28:52.805
When last I looked...

01:28:53.247 --> 01:28:56.876
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

01:29:03.691 --> 01:29:05.955
Then what is the king's decision?

01:29:11.564 --> 01:29:12.895
By order of the king...

01:29:13.066 --> 01:29:14.533
the city must empty.

01:29:15.702 --> 01:29:18.569
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

01:29:18.872 --> 01:29:22.774
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

01:29:22.976 --> 01:29:24.466
Helm's Deep.

01:29:24.644 --> 01:29:28.171
They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight.

01:29:28.348 --> 01:29:30.316
Who will defend them if not their king?

01:29:30.483 --> 01:29:32.951
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

01:29:33.119 --> 01:29:34.916
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

01:29:35.088 --> 01:29:38.990
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

01:29:39.192 --> 01:29:41.353
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

01:29:41.561 --> 01:29:43.688
What they will get is a massacre.

01:29:45.265 --> 01:29:47.733
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

01:29:48.635 --> 01:29:51.968
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

01:29:52.439 --> 01:29:55.306
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

01:29:55.775 --> 01:29:58.573
The people of Rohan will need you.

01:29:58.945 --> 01:30:01.413
The defenses have to hold.

01:30:02.849 --> 01:30:04.578
They will hold.

01:30:08.588 --> 01:30:10.886
The Grey Pilgrim.

01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:13.684
That's what they used to call me.

01:30:13.892 --> 01:30:18.955
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

01:30:20.599 --> 01:30:22.794
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:26.634
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:30.202
At dawn, look to the east.

01:30:30.376 --> 01:30:31.934
Go.

01:30:59.271 --> 01:31:02.604
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

01:31:41.646 --> 01:31:43.705
His name is Brego.

01:31:45.216 --> 01:31:47.116
He was my cousin's horse.

01:31:47.351 --> 01:31:49.148
Brego.

01:32:03.868 --> 01:32:06.268
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

01:32:06.437 --> 01:32:09.736
but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:13.209
You speak as one of their own.

01:32:15.012 --> 01:32:17.446
I was raised in Rivendell...

01:32:17.715 --> 01:32:19.238
for a time.

01:32:22.552 --> 01:32:24.577
Turn this fellow free.

01:32:25.255 --> 01:32:27.723
He's seen enough of war.

01:32:39.503 --> 01:32:42.370
Gandalf the White.

01:32:42.539 --> 01:32:44.905
Gandalf the Fool!

01:32:46.176 --> 01:32:50.237
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

01:32:51.481 --> 01:32:55.417
There were three who followed the wizard.

01:32:55.819 --> 01:33:01.189
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

01:33:01.558 --> 01:33:04.288
You stink of horse.

01:33:09.566 --> 01:33:11.431
The Man...

01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:17.668
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

01:33:17.841 --> 01:33:21.640
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.607
His cloth was poor.

01:33:24.513 --> 01:33:29.644
And yet he bore a strange ring.

01:33:30.753 --> 01:33:34.280
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:40.326
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.

01:33:40.496 --> 01:33:42.396
The Ring of Barahir.

01:33:43.365 --> 01:33:46.960
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

01:33:47.136 --> 01:33:50.469
The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool.

01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:53.369
The line was broken years ago.

01:33:54.743 --> 01:33:56.267
It matters not.

01:33:56.445 --> 01:33:58.970
The world of Men shall fall.

01:33:59.148 --> 01:34:01.013
It will begin at Edoras.

01:34:10.192 --> 01:34:12.126
I am ready, Gamling.

01:34:12.294 --> 01:34:14.762
Bring my horse.

01:34:17.933 --> 01:34:19.298
This is not a defeat.

01:34:21.704 --> 01:34:22.932
We will return.

01:34:28.376 --> 01:34:30.776
We will return.

01:34:54.202 --> 01:34:56.136
You have some skill with a blade.

01:35:04.579 --> 01:35:06.672
Women of this country learned long ago:

01:35:06.848 --> 01:35:09.476
Those without swords can still die upon them.

01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:11.482
I fear neither death nor pain.

01:35:12.754 --> 01:35:14.847
What do you fear, my lady?

01:35:18.259 --> 01:35:20.090
A cage.

01:35:21.396 --> 01:35:25.230
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:29.301
And all chance of valor has
gone beyond recall or desire.

01:35:32.739 --> 01:35:34.764
You're a daughter of kings...

01:35:36.043 --> 01:35:39.342
a shield maiden of Rohan.

01:35:44.651 --> 01:35:47.142
I do not think that would be your fate.

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:23.212
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

01:36:23.423 --> 01:36:25.482
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

01:36:25.692 --> 01:36:28.593
He will expect an attack on the city.

01:36:29.896 --> 01:36:33.160
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

01:36:33.332 --> 01:36:35.664
the great fortress of Rohan.

01:36:36.869 --> 01:36:41.272
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

01:36:42.708 --> 01:36:44.437
They will be slow.

01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:49.247
They will have women and children with them.

01:36:53.152 --> 01:36:55.382
Send out your Warg-riders.

01:37:10.236 --> 01:37:13.137
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

01:37:13.305 --> 01:37:15.967
- Why do you do that?
- What?

01:37:16.142 --> 01:37:18.667
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

01:37:19.111 --> 01:37:21.136
Because.

01:37:22.681 --> 01:37:24.808
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

01:37:25.017 --> 01:37:27.178
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

01:37:27.653 --> 01:37:30.417
It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.

01:37:30.589 --> 01:37:32.853
You have no idea what it did to him...

01:37:33.025 --> 01:37:35.492
what it's still doing to him.

01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:39.822
I want to help him, Sam.

01:37:39.998 --> 01:37:41.260
Why?

01:37:46.571 --> 01:37:49.699
Because I have to believe he can come back.

01:37:53.945 --> 01:37:55.879
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

01:37:56.047 --> 01:37:58.777
What do you know about it? Nothing!

01:38:05.690 --> 01:38:09.888
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

01:38:10.728 --> 01:38:11.854
I do.

01:38:13.898 --> 01:38:15.763
It's the Ring.

01:38:16.334 --> 01:38:17.892
You can't take your eyes off it.

01:38:18.636 --> 01:38:20.604
I've seen you.

01:38:21.072 --> 01:38:24.906
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

01:38:26.678 --> 01:38:28.908
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.776
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

01:38:31.983 --> 01:38:34.918
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

01:38:35.086 --> 01:38:36.781
Mine! My own!

01:38:37.654 --> 01:38:39.747
Can't you hear yourself?

01:38:39.957 --> 01:38:41.618
Don't you know who you sound like?

01:38:51.902 --> 01:38:54.029
We wants it.

01:38:54.204 --> 01:38:56.900
We needs it.

01:38:57.074 --> 01:39:01.875
Must have the precious.

01:39:02.045 --> 01:39:05.412
They stole it from us.

01:39:05.616 --> 01:39:08.983
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

01:39:09.152 --> 01:39:13.054
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

01:39:13.223 --> 01:39:16.488
No. Not master.

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:20.494
Yes, precious. False.

01:39:20.664 --> 01:39:25.158
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

01:39:26.303 --> 01:39:28.771
Master's my friend.

01:39:28.939 --> 01:39:34.002
You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.

01:39:35.279 --> 01:39:37.770
Not listening. I'm not listening.

01:39:37.948 --> 01:39:41.940
You're a liar and a thief.

01:39:42.618 --> 01:39:44.142
No.

01:39:45.087 --> 01:39:47.988
Murderer.

01:39:50.459 --> 01:39:51.483
Go away.

01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:54.027
Go away?

01:39:56.032 --> 01:39:58.830
I hate you.

01:39:59.001 --> 01:40:01.401
I hate you.

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:05.003
Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum.

01:40:05.174 --> 01:40:07.005
I saved us.

01:40:07.176 --> 01:40:11.704
It was me. We survived because of me.

01:40:12.949 --> 01:40:16.510
Not anymore.

01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:19.411
What did you say?

01:40:21.524 --> 01:40:25.358
Master looks after us now.

01:40:25.528 --> 01:40:29.020
We don't need you.

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.290
What?

01:40:31.467 --> 01:40:33.230
Leave now...

01:40:33.402 --> 01:40:37.202
and never come back.

01:40:37.373 --> 01:40:38.397
No.

01:40:38.908 --> 01:40:43.106
Leave now and never come back.

01:40:45.747 --> 01:40:51.652
Leave now and never come back!

01:41:03.565 --> 01:41:06.261
We told him to go away.

01:41:06.434 --> 01:41:09.403
And away he goes, precious.

01:41:09.571 --> 01:41:11.562
Gone! Gone! Gone!

01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.571
Smeagol is free!

01:41:18.446 --> 01:41:19.936
Look.

01:41:20.148 --> 01:41:24.608
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

01:41:34.162 --> 01:41:35.595
They are young.

01:41:35.764 --> 01:41:38.289
They are tender. They are nice.

01:41:38.466 --> 01:41:41.993
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

01:41:44.706 --> 01:41:46.298
You'll make him sick, you will...

01:41:47.508 --> 01:41:49.703
behaving like that.

01:41:52.146 --> 01:41:54.876
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

01:41:59.119 --> 01:42:00.643
What's it doing?

01:42:01.388 --> 01:42:03.982
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

01:42:04.158 --> 01:42:06.353
It ruins it.

01:42:06.527 --> 01:42:10.156
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

01:42:14.301 --> 01:42:16.861
What we need is a few good taters.

01:42:17.738 --> 01:42:20.798
What's taters, precious?

01:42:20.974 --> 01:42:22.703
What's taters? Eh?

01:42:22.876 --> 01:42:24.605
Po-ta-toes.

01:42:24.945 --> 01:42:28.176
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

01:42:29.717 --> 01:42:35.178
Lovely, big, golden chips with
a nice piece of fried fish.

01:42:36.523 --> 01:42:38.423
Even you couldn't say no to that.

01:42:38.759 --> 01:42:40.954
Oh, yes, we could.

01:42:41.128 --> 01:42:44.620
Spoil a nice fish.

01:42:45.899 --> 01:42:48.527
Give it to us raw...

01:42:48.702 --> 01:42:51.727
and wriggling.

01:42:51.904 --> 01:42:55.032
You keep nasty chips.

01:42:55.975 --> 01:42:58.034
You're hopeless.

01:43:10.523 --> 01:43:12.013
Mr. Frodo?

01:43:29.909 --> 01:43:32.571
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

01:43:32.779 --> 01:43:35.247
Servants of Sauron.

01:43:36.048 --> 01:43:38.209
They are called to Mordor.

01:43:38.417 --> 01:43:41.409
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:44.784
It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.

01:43:46.359 --> 01:43:50.022
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

01:43:50.196 --> 01:43:55.360
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.

01:43:55.634 --> 01:43:58.694
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

01:43:58.870 --> 01:44:00.098
Mr. Frodo.

01:44:00.605 --> 01:44:02.232
Look.

01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:08.109
It's an oliphaunt.

01:44:16.321 --> 01:44:19.347
No one at home will believe this.

01:44:30.502 --> 01:44:32.367
Smeagol?

01:45:12.743 --> 01:45:15.211
We've lingered here too long.

01:45:18.215 --> 01:45:19.546
Come on, Sam.

01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:35.726
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

01:45:37.434 --> 01:45:42.531
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

01:45:42.706 --> 01:45:45.607
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

01:45:47.011 --> 01:45:50.378
Those that claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder us.

01:45:50.547 --> 01:45:52.572
The enemy?

01:45:54.685 --> 01:45:58.177
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

01:46:00.623 --> 01:46:02.682
You wonder what his name is...

01:46:04.193 --> 01:46:06.457
where he came from.

01:46:08.431 --> 01:46:10.865
And if he was really evil at heart.

01:46:12.535 --> 01:46:15.993
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

01:46:17.607 --> 01:46:20.098
If he would not rather have stayed there...

01:46:22.312 --> 01:46:23.802
in peace.

01:46:27.383 --> 01:46:30.409
War will make corpses of us all.

01:46:30.586 --> 01:46:32.645
Bind their hands.

01:46:39.534 --> 01:46:42.230
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

01:46:42.437 --> 01:46:46.100
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

01:46:46.274 --> 01:46:49.436
that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

01:46:49.843 --> 01:46:51.743
It's the beards.

01:46:51.945 --> 01:46:54.073
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

01:46:54.248 --> 01:46:57.116
that there are no Dwarf women...

01:46:57.284 --> 01:47:01.551
and that Dwarves just spring
out of holes in the ground...

01:47:03.223 --> 01:47:05.088
which is, of course, ridiculous.

01:47:11.231 --> 01:47:13.461
It's all right. Nobody panic.

01:47:13.934 --> 01:47:15.959
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

01:47:17.904 --> 01:47:21.704
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.

01:47:21.974 --> 01:47:24.739
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.

01:47:24.911 --> 01:47:27.210
Cut down by Orcs.

01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:30.373
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

01:47:30.984 --> 01:47:35.613
Then she was left alone, to
tend her king in growing fear.

01:47:35.788 --> 01:47:40.350
Doomed to wait upon an old man who
should have loved her as a father.

01:47:50.369 --> 01:47:52.735
Gimli.

01:47:52.905 --> 01:47:54.964
No, I couldn't

01:47:55.141 --> 01:47:56.972
I really couldn't.

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.107
I made some stew.

01:48:03.281 --> 01:48:06.547
It isn't much, but it's hot.

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:16.418
Thank you.

01:48:36.914 --> 01:48:39.440
- It's good.
- Really?

01:48:43.421 --> 01:48:46.788
My uncle told me a strange thing.

01:48:48.092 --> 01:48:52.153
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

01:48:52.596 --> 01:48:55.065
But he must be mistaken.

01:48:55.332 --> 01:48:59.736
King Theoden has a good memory. He
was only a small child at the time.

01:49:00.871 --> 01:49:04.069
Then you must be at least 60.

01:49:06.177 --> 01:49:07.735
Seventy?

01:49:08.179 --> 01:49:09.841
But you cannot be 80!

01:49:13.184 --> 01:49:14.549
Eighty-seven.

01:49:17.655 --> 01:49:19.748
You are one of the Dunedain.

01:49:20.824 --> 01:49:23.918
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.

01:49:25.162 --> 01:49:27.790
It was said that your race had passed into legend.

01:49:28.465 --> 01:49:30.228
There are few of us left.

01:49:30.402 --> 01:49:33.164
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

01:49:33.938 --> 01:49:37.339
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

01:49:51.989 --> 01:49:56.118
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.

01:49:56.926 --> 01:50:00.362
It is mine to give to whom I will.

01:50:02.198 --> 01:50:04.598
Like my heart.

01:50:06.035 --> 01:50:08.731
Go to sleep.

01:50:08.905 --> 01:50:11.396
I am asleep.

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.814
This is a dream.

01:50:22.050 --> 01:50:25.248
Then it is a good dream.

01:50:37.233 --> 01:50:39.325
Sleep.

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.782
You told me once...

01:51:07.894 --> 01:51:10.080
this day would come.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.626
This is not the end... it is the beginning.

01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:16.500
You must go with Frodo.

01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:19.500
That is your path.

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:31.500
My path is hidden from me.

01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:35.500
It is already laid before your feet.

01:51:36.500 --> 01:51:39.335
You cannot falter now.

01:51:42.296 --> 01:51:44.195
Arwen...

01:51:42.500 --> 01:51:45.401
Arwen...

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:48.400
If you trust nothing else...

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:51.629
trust this...

01:51:51.955 --> 01:51:54.988
trust us.

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:35.477
Where is she?

01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:39.083
The woman who gave you that jewel.

01:52:42.389 --> 01:52:45.152
Our time here is ending.

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:48.383
Arwen's time is ending.

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:50.423
Let her go.

01:52:50.597 --> 01:52:52.587
Let her take the ship into the west.

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:55.859
Let her bear away her love
for you to the Undying Lands.

01:52:56.035 --> 01:52:57.832
There it will be ever green.

01:52:59.338 --> 01:53:01.704
But never more than memory.

01:53:02.975 --> 01:53:06.001
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

01:53:06.178 --> 01:53:09.807
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

01:53:09.982 --> 01:53:12.280
She belongs with her people.

01:53:24.250 --> 01:53:26.831
Is this how you would take your leave?

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.218
Did you think you could slip away at
first light - unnoticed?

01:53:33.624 --> 01:53:35.200
I will not be coming back.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.300
You underestimate your skill in battle.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.200
You will come back.

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.000
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.300
What do you speak of?

01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:53.839
You have a chance for another life...

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:59.100
away from war... grief... despair.

01:54:00.598 --> 01:54:02.429
Why are you saying this?

01:54:04.001 --> 01:54:07.198
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

01:54:08.639 --> 01:54:11.301
It was a dream, Arwen.

01:54:11.742 --> 01:54:13.106
Nothing more.

01:54:14.479 --> 01:54:17.709
I don't believe you.

01:54:26.724 --> 01:54:28.554
This belongs to you.

01:54:31.328 --> 01:54:32.886
It was a gift.

01:54:35.499 --> 01:54:37.023
Keep it.

01:54:39.536 --> 01:54:40.731
My lord?

01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:48.102
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

01:55:11.601 --> 01:55:13.067
What is it?

01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:16.629
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

01:55:33.155 --> 01:55:35.179
Wargs!

01:55:47.736 --> 01:55:49.431
A scout!

01:55:55.743 --> 01:55:58.268
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

01:55:59.614 --> 01:56:01.809
Get them out of here!

01:56:06.588 --> 01:56:08.579
All riders to the head of the column.

01:56:09.324 --> 01:56:11.293
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

01:56:11.492 --> 01:56:13.221
Come on!

01:56:25.039 --> 01:56:27.472
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

01:56:27.674 --> 01:56:29.142
- I can fight.
- No!

01:56:31.846 --> 01:56:33.905
You must do this, for me.

01:56:35.917 --> 01:56:37.509
Follow me!

01:56:41.055 --> 01:56:45.354
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

01:56:45.559 --> 01:56:48.222
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

01:58:00.432 --> 01:58:02.731
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

01:58:05.538 --> 01:58:07.095
That one counts as mine!

01:58:23.822 --> 01:58:25.449
Stinking creature.

01:59:52.643 --> 01:59:54.542
Aragorn!

01:59:59.282 --> 02:00:00.749
Aragorn?

02:00:14.729 --> 02:00:17.664
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.

02:00:17.834 --> 02:00:19.266
He's...

02:00:19.836 --> 02:00:21.428
dead.

02:00:22.071 --> 02:00:24.971
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

02:00:28.577 --> 02:00:29.874
You lie.

02:01:03.778 --> 02:01:05.370
Get the wounded on horses.

02:01:06.715 --> 02:01:09.842
The wolves of Isengard will return.

02:01:10.284 --> 02:01:12.377
Leave the dead.

02:01:19.827 --> 02:01:21.317
Come.

02:01:31.506 --> 02:01:33.029
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

02:01:33.208 --> 02:01:36.108
There it is, Helm's Deep.

02:01:38.678 --> 02:01:40.476
We're safe!

02:01:42.016 --> 02:01:44.883
We're safe, my lady.

02:01:45.051 --> 02:01:46.246
Thank you.

02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:32.029
- Mama!
- Eothain!

02:02:32.197 --> 02:02:33.688
Freda!

02:02:39.438 --> 02:02:42.272
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

02:02:46.145 --> 02:02:47.441
Take it to the caves.

02:02:47.646 --> 02:02:50.479
Make way for the king.

02:02:51.516 --> 02:02:55.316
Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.

02:03:03.228 --> 02:03:06.959
So few. So few of you have returned.

02:03:09.734 --> 02:03:11.999
Our people are safe.

02:03:13.337 --> 02:03:15.898
We have paid for it with many lives.

02:03:16.741 --> 02:03:18.266
My lady.

02:03:22.013 --> 02:03:24.277
Lord Aragorn...

02:03:24.449 --> 02:03:25.677
where is he?

02:03:27.685 --> 02:03:29.210
He fell.

02:03:51.875 --> 02:03:54.845
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

02:03:55.012 --> 02:03:57.947
Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.

02:03:58.182 --> 02:04:01.275
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

02:04:01.452 --> 02:04:04.046
Get them into the caves.

02:04:04.922 --> 02:04:09.790
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

02:04:11.829 --> 02:04:15.230
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

02:04:15.398 --> 02:04:17.731
Its outer wall is solid rock...

02:04:17.901 --> 02:04:20.996
but for a small culvert at its base...

02:04:21.171 --> 02:04:23.935
which is little more than a drain.

02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:30.974
How? How can fire undo stone?

02:04:31.148 --> 02:04:35.641
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

02:04:39.254 --> 02:04:43.248
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

02:04:43.425 --> 02:04:46.952
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

02:04:47.130 --> 02:04:49.690
thousands, to storm the Keep.

02:04:49.866 --> 02:04:51.298
Tens of thousands.

02:04:51.467 --> 02:04:55.528
But, my lord, there is no such force.

02:05:07.483 --> 02:05:10.577
A new power is rising.

02:05:10.752 --> 02:05:13.744
Its victory is at hand.

02:05:19.429 --> 02:05:21.486
This night...

02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:26.263
the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

02:05:26.435 --> 02:05:29.768
March to Helm's Deep!

02:05:29.938 --> 02:05:33.374
Leave none alive!

02:05:35.911 --> 02:05:38.378
To war!

02:05:42.316 --> 02:05:46.777
There will be no dawn for Men.

02:06:03.972 --> 02:06:06.029
Look. There's smoke to the south.

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:09.368
There is always smoke rising...

02:06:09.610 --> 02:06:13.444
from Isengard these days.

02:06:13.681 --> 02:06:15.273
Isengard?

02:06:15.483 --> 02:06:17.348
There was a time...

02:06:17.685 --> 02:06:21.211
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

02:06:21.388 --> 02:06:24.756
But now he has a mind of metal...

02:06:25.426 --> 02:06:27.859
and wheels.

02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:33.123
He no longer cares for growing things.

02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.097
What is it?

02:06:40.106 --> 02:06:42.301
It's Saruman's army.

02:06:42.509 --> 02:06:44.033
The war has started.

02:07:22.414 --> 02:07:26.783
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

02:07:59.051 --> 02:08:00.915
Brego.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.200
Arwen.

02:08:27.044 --> 02:08:28.239
Arwen.

02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.200
It is time.

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:37.000
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now... before it is too late.

02:08:38.022 --> 02:08:39.818
I have made my choice.

02:08:46.263 --> 02:08:49.130
He is not coming back.

02:08:50.567 --> 02:08:53.900
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

02:08:54.838 --> 02:08:57.808
There is still hope.

02:09:01.978 --> 02:09:05.744
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

02:09:09.152 --> 02:09:12.121
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

02:09:12.289 --> 02:09:14.780
and all that you hope for comes true...

02:09:14.958 --> 02:09:19.656
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

02:09:19.929 --> 02:09:22.922
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

02:09:23.099 --> 02:09:26.069
Aragorn will die.

02:09:28.905 --> 02:09:31.430
And there will be no comfort for you...

02:09:31.641 --> 02:09:35.804
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

02:09:38.615 --> 02:09:41.345
He will come to death...

02:09:41.517 --> 02:09:44.111
an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

02:09:44.287 --> 02:09:48.950
in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

02:09:58.067 --> 02:10:02.003
But you, my daughter...

02:10:02.837 --> 02:10:07.865
you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

02:10:08.043 --> 02:10:12.104
as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

02:10:14.517 --> 02:10:16.916
Here you will dwell...

02:10:17.086 --> 02:10:21.988
bound to your grief under the fading trees...

02:10:23.726 --> 02:10:25.716
until all the world is changed...

02:10:25.894 --> 02:10:30.389
and the long years of your life are utterly spent.

02:10:38.907 --> 02:10:40.067
Arwen.

02:10:46.714 --> 02:10:48.977
There is nothing for you here...

02:10:49.650 --> 02:10:51.743
only death.

02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:14.900
Do I not also have your love?

02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:19.300
You have my love, father.

02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:13.097
The world is changed.

02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:15.750
I feel it in the water.

02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.200
I feel it in the earth,

02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:22.100
and I smell it in the air.

02:12:25.210 --> 02:12:28.839
The power of the enemy is growing.

02:12:29.015 --> 02:12:31.642
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

02:12:31.816 --> 02:12:35.184
to destroy the people of Rohan.

02:12:37.255 --> 02:12:40.884
Isengard has been unleashed.

02:12:45.230 --> 02:12:48.597
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

02:12:49.734 --> 02:12:52.702
the last free kingdom of Men.

02:12:52.904 --> 02:12:57.307
His war on this country will come swiftly.

02:13:01.011 --> 02:13:04.105
He senses the Ring is close.

02:13:04.282 --> 02:13:07.740
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

02:13:07.919 --> 02:13:11.980
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

02:13:13.525 --> 02:13:17.392
the quest will claim his life.

02:13:17.561 --> 02:13:19.723
You know this.

02:13:20.364 --> 02:13:23.197
You have foreseen it.

02:13:25.303 --> 02:13:28.738
It is the risk we all took.

02:13:33.077 --> 02:13:37.275
In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

02:13:38.449 --> 02:13:42.886
It works hard now to find its
way back into the hands of Men.

02:13:43.053 --> 02:13:48.513
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

02:13:48.725 --> 02:13:52.287
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

02:13:52.495 --> 02:13:56.556
take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

02:13:59.003 --> 02:14:00.833
It is close now.

02:14:01.004 --> 02:14:05.270
So close to achieving its goal.

02:14:08.378 --> 02:14:12.008
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

02:14:12.182 --> 02:14:16.311
even unto to the ending of the world.

02:14:18.153 --> 02:14:19.985
The time of the Elves...

02:14:20.188 --> 02:14:22.123
is over.

02:14:22.959 --> 02:14:26.554
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

02:14:28.531 --> 02:14:31.795
Do we let them stand alone?

02:14:36.338 --> 02:14:37.703
What news?

02:14:37.874 --> 02:14:40.672
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

02:14:40.843 --> 02:14:43.710
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:47.907
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

02:14:48.083 --> 02:14:50.483
Sauron is marshaling an army.

02:14:50.819 --> 02:14:52.946
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

02:14:53.122 --> 02:14:56.523
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

02:14:57.627 --> 02:15:01.187
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

02:15:01.396 --> 02:15:04.422
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

02:15:06.568 --> 02:15:08.763
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

02:15:08.937 --> 02:15:11.633
Sauron from Mordor.

02:15:12.941 --> 02:15:16.172
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

02:15:16.343 --> 02:15:18.038
Gondor is weak.

02:15:18.213 --> 02:15:21.340
Sauron will strike us soon.

02:15:22.084 --> 02:15:23.948
And he will strike hard.

02:15:24.386 --> 02:15:28.482
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

02:15:42.369 --> 02:15:44.599
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

02:15:44.772 --> 02:15:47.502
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

02:15:47.675 --> 02:15:49.939
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

02:15:56.817 --> 02:15:58.546
Speak.

02:15:59.652 --> 02:16:02.246
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

02:16:02.589 --> 02:16:05.616
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:07.550
Your bodyguard?

02:16:07.762 --> 02:16:09.525
His gardener.

02:16:10.164 --> 02:16:12.132
And where is your skulking friend?

02:16:13.667 --> 02:16:15.965
That gangrel creature.

02:16:16.303 --> 02:16:18.270
He had an ill-favored look.

02:16:20.006 --> 02:16:21.906
There was no other.

02:16:26.012 --> 02:16:28.345
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

02:16:31.684 --> 02:16:34.744
One we lost in Moria...

02:16:35.822 --> 02:16:37.346
two were my kin...

02:16:37.524 --> 02:16:41.255
a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men.

02:16:41.461 --> 02:16:45.363
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

02:16:50.370 --> 02:16:52.133
You're a friend of Boromir?

02:16:54.574 --> 02:16:56.064
Yes.

02:16:57.143 --> 02:16:58.235
For my part.

02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:07.685
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

02:17:09.721 --> 02:17:11.189
Dead?

02:17:11.391 --> 02:17:13.415
How? When?

02:17:13.692 --> 02:17:16.319
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.

02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:20.496
If something has happened to
Boromir, we would have you tell us.

02:17:23.236 --> 02:17:29.697
His horn washed up upon the
riverbank, about six days past.

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:33.002
It was cloven in two.

02:17:34.612 --> 02:17:38.013
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

02:17:40.052 --> 02:17:41.849
He was my brother.

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:33.770
Boromir!

02:18:34.304 --> 02:18:36.170
Boromir!

02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:44.176
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

02:18:44.347 --> 02:18:48.010
A place of light and beauty and music.

02:18:48.184 --> 02:18:50.516
And so it shall be once more!

02:18:53.090 --> 02:18:55.718
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

02:18:55.927 --> 02:19:00.294
Never again will the land of
my people fall into enemy hands.

02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:09.766
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!

02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:12.107
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

02:19:12.274 --> 02:19:15.107
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

02:19:23.819 --> 02:19:26.584
Good speech. Nice and short.

02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:29.690
Leaves more time for drinking!

02:19:29.992 --> 02:19:34.190
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

02:19:37.634 --> 02:19:39.795
Remember today, little brother.

02:19:39.969 --> 02:19:42.961
Today, life is good.

02:19:47.142 --> 02:19:48.734
What?

02:19:49.111 --> 02:19:50.578
He's here.

02:19:53.782 --> 02:19:55.614
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?

02:19:55.784 --> 02:19:56.807
Where is he?

02:19:56.985 --> 02:20:00.443
Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?

02:20:01.022 --> 02:20:02.717
Father!

02:20:07.596 --> 02:20:09.962
They say you vanquished the
enemy almost single-handedly.

02:20:10.132 --> 02:20:13.532
They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.

02:20:15.003 --> 02:20:17.904
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

02:20:18.706 --> 02:20:21.004
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

02:20:21.176 --> 02:20:23.201
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

02:20:23.378 --> 02:20:25.073
Oh, too few.

02:20:25.581 --> 02:20:27.980
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

02:20:30.183 --> 02:20:33.176
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

02:20:33.388 --> 02:20:35.617
That is not my intent.

02:20:35.823 --> 02:20:39.589
You give him no credit, and
yet he tries to do your will.

02:20:42.963 --> 02:20:45.864
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

02:20:46.034 --> 02:20:48.797
I know his uses, and they are few.

02:20:48.970 --> 02:20:52.564
We have more urgent things to speak of.

02:20:53.741 --> 02:20:56.174
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

02:20:56.343 --> 02:20:59.210
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

02:20:59.379 --> 02:21:03.179
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

02:21:05.419 --> 02:21:07.683
The One Ring.

02:21:10.458 --> 02:21:15.121
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

02:21:15.294 --> 02:21:18.924
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards.

02:21:19.099 --> 02:21:23.229
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

02:21:25.039 --> 02:21:27.699
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

02:21:27.874 --> 02:21:31.570
Ever the Ring will seek to
corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.

02:21:31.744 --> 02:21:35.647
But you, you are strong. And our need is great.

02:21:35.816 --> 02:21:41.117
It is our blood which is being
spilled, our people who are dying.

02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:46.348
Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies.

02:21:46.559 --> 02:21:48.026
He will return.

02:21:48.227 --> 02:21:51.959
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

02:21:52.131 --> 02:21:54.692
You must go.

02:21:55.867 --> 02:21:57.961
Bring me back this mighty gift.

02:21:58.803 --> 02:22:04.299
No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.

02:22:04.477 --> 02:22:08.174
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

02:22:08.347 --> 02:22:11.315
- send me in his stead.
- You?

02:22:12.518 --> 02:22:14.452
Oh, I see.

02:22:14.619 --> 02:22:18.817
A chance for Faramir, captain
of Gondor, to show his quality.

02:22:19.257 --> 02:22:21.226
I think not.

02:22:21.426 --> 02:22:24.294
I trust this mission only to your brother.

02:22:24.463 --> 02:22:27.363
The one who will not fail me.

02:22:44.449 --> 02:22:47.612
Remember today, little brother.

02:23:06.004 --> 02:23:07.994
Captain Faramir!

02:23:09.274 --> 02:23:11.400
We found the third one.

02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:24.888
You must come with me. Now.

02:23:36.099 --> 02:23:37.191
Down there.

02:23:52.115 --> 02:23:55.015
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.

02:24:05.628 --> 02:24:07.118
They wait for my command.

02:24:12.602 --> 02:24:13.694
Shall I shoot?

02:24:14.937 --> 02:24:17.963
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

02:24:18.140 --> 02:24:19.971
So juicy sweet

02:24:20.610 --> 02:24:23.579
Our only wish To catch a fish

02:24:23.747 --> 02:24:26.441
So juicy sweet

02:24:33.422 --> 02:24:34.820
Wait.

02:24:36.325 --> 02:24:39.157
This creature is bound to me.

02:24:39.761 --> 02:24:41.695
And I to him.

02:24:44.966 --> 02:24:46.264
He is our guide.

02:24:51.007 --> 02:24:52.406
Please...

02:24:52.575 --> 02:24:54.439
let me go down to him.

02:25:05.754 --> 02:25:07.415
Smeagol.

02:25:08.423 --> 02:25:10.652
Master is here.

02:25:11.859 --> 02:25:12.985
Come, Smeagol.

02:25:15.864 --> 02:25:18.492
Trust master. Come.

02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:25.503
We must go now?

02:25:25.873 --> 02:25:29.310
Smeagol, you must trust master.

02:25:29.476 --> 02:25:30.875
Follow me. Come on.

02:25:32.112 --> 02:25:33.602
Come.

02:25:36.151 --> 02:25:37.310
Come, Smeagol.

02:25:37.852 --> 02:25:39.876
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

02:25:40.421 --> 02:25:41.911
Come on.

02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:48.021
Don't hurt him!

02:25:48.196 --> 02:25:50.925
Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.

02:25:51.098 --> 02:25:52.396
Master!

02:26:36.817 --> 02:26:41.584
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

02:26:42.856 --> 02:26:45.450
Cruel Men hurts us.

02:26:45.659 --> 02:26:48.628
Master tricksed us.

02:26:48.829 --> 02:26:52.390
Of course he did.

02:26:52.766 --> 02:26:56.463
I told you he was tricksy.

02:26:56.636 --> 02:26:59.662
I told you he was false.

02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:02.536
Master is our friend.

02:27:02.709 --> 02:27:05.075
Our friend.

02:27:05.245 --> 02:27:07.406
Master betrayed us.

02:27:07.581 --> 02:27:10.573
No. Not its business.

02:27:11.651 --> 02:27:14.119
Leave us alone!

02:27:14.287 --> 02:27:16.687
Filthy little Hobbitses!

02:27:16.857 --> 02:27:19.155
They stole it from us!

02:27:19.326 --> 02:27:20.759
No. No.

02:27:21.328 --> 02:27:22.955
What did they steal?

02:27:25.098 --> 02:27:30.434
My precious!

02:27:34.074 --> 02:27:35.701
We have to get out of here.

02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:38.277
You go. Go, now.

02:27:40.881 --> 02:27:42.746
You can do it.

02:27:44.184 --> 02:27:45.651
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

02:27:45.852 --> 02:27:47.615
Just this once.

02:27:47.821 --> 02:27:49.550
Put it on.

02:27:50.023 --> 02:27:52.014
Disappear.

02:27:53.093 --> 02:27:54.151
I can't.

02:27:57.264 --> 02:27:59.494
You were right, Sam.

02:28:00.934 --> 02:28:03.425
You tried to tell me but...

02:28:08.141 --> 02:28:10.302
I'm sorry.

02:28:14.848 --> 02:28:17.715
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

02:28:19.152 --> 02:28:20.779
If I put it on...

02:28:20.987 --> 02:28:23.319
he'll find me.

02:28:24.991 --> 02:28:26.959
He'll see.

02:28:28.194 --> 02:28:30.162
Mr. Frodo...

02:28:35.035 --> 02:28:39.301
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

02:28:41.508 --> 02:28:44.500
Here in the Wild I have you...

02:28:44.678 --> 02:28:46.578
two Halflings...

02:28:46.746 --> 02:28:49.909
and a host of men at my call.

02:28:53.253 --> 02:28:56.711
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

02:29:06.433 --> 02:29:10.164
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

02:29:11.771 --> 02:29:14.797
to show his quality.

02:29:35.895 --> 02:29:37.487
No!

02:29:40.667 --> 02:29:41.998
Stop it!

02:29:42.168 --> 02:29:43.226
Leave him alone.

02:29:44.571 --> 02:29:47.062
Don't you understand?

02:29:48.375 --> 02:29:50.275
He's got to destroy it!

02:29:50.443 --> 02:29:53.674
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

02:29:53.847 --> 02:29:55.508
To the Mountain of Fire!

02:29:56.583 --> 02:29:59.677
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

02:29:59.886 --> 02:30:02.855
Please. It's such a burden.

02:30:05.058 --> 02:30:07.117
Will you not help him?

02:30:08.495 --> 02:30:10.395
Captain?

02:30:11.064 --> 02:30:13.294
Prepare to leave.

02:30:18.238 --> 02:30:20.672
The Ring will go to Gondor.

02:31:33.613 --> 02:31:36.241
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

02:31:36.416 --> 02:31:39.476
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

02:31:39.686 --> 02:31:43.417
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

02:31:43.623 --> 02:31:47.616
and the most reckless man I ever knew.

02:31:48.328 --> 02:31:49.795
Bless you, laddie.

02:31:50.396 --> 02:31:52.125
Gimli, where is the king?

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.250
You're late.

02:32:05.912 --> 02:32:07.243
You look terrible.

02:32:48.988 --> 02:32:51.013
A great host, you say?

02:32:51.224 --> 02:32:53.886
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

02:32:54.561 --> 02:32:57.553
Ten thousand strong at least.

02:32:59.098 --> 02:33:00.531
Ten thousand?

02:33:00.967 --> 02:33:03.458
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

02:33:06.139 --> 02:33:08.266
To destroy the world of Men.

02:33:10.777 --> 02:33:12.768
They will be here by nightfall.

02:33:18.618 --> 02:33:19.915
Let them come!

02:33:21.454 --> 02:33:24.184
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

02:33:24.390 --> 02:33:27.518
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

02:33:35.702 --> 02:33:38.637
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

02:33:38.805 --> 02:33:41.239
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...

02:33:41.407 --> 02:33:44.137
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

02:33:44.310 --> 02:33:46.710
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

02:33:47.313 --> 02:33:49.508
These are Uruk-hai.

02:33:49.682 --> 02:33:53.118
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.

02:33:54.787 --> 02:33:58.416
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

02:33:58.625 --> 02:34:02.220
I know how to defend my own keep.

02:34:08.835 --> 02:34:12.236
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

02:34:12.405 --> 02:34:17.638
Saruman's hordes will pillage
and burn. We've seen it before.

02:34:17.844 --> 02:34:20.506
Crops can be resown...

02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:23.672
homes rebuilt.

02:34:24.284 --> 02:34:26.844
Within these walls...

02:34:27.253 --> 02:34:28.720
we will outlast them.

02:34:28.922 --> 02:34:31.322
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

02:34:31.491 --> 02:34:33.015
They come to destroy its people...

02:34:33.159 --> 02:34:35.627
down to the last child.

02:34:36.529 --> 02:34:38.793
What would you have me do?

02:34:38.965 --> 02:34:40.694
Look at my men.

02:34:40.867 --> 02:34:42.596
Their courage hangs by a thread.

02:34:44.804 --> 02:34:49.207
If this is to be our end, then I
would have them make such an end...

02:34:49.375 --> 02:34:52.401
as to be worthy of remembrance.

02:34:56.049 --> 02:34:57.949
Send out riders, my lord.

02:34:58.251 --> 02:35:01.118
You must call for aid.

02:35:04.424 --> 02:35:06.688
And who will come?

02:35:07.093 --> 02:35:08.685
Elves?

02:35:08.861 --> 02:35:10.920
Dwarves?

02:35:11.698 --> 02:35:14.565
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

02:35:15.401 --> 02:35:17.665
The old alliances are dead.

02:35:18.104 --> 02:35:20.902
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

02:35:21.074 --> 02:35:23.269
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

02:35:24.243 --> 02:35:27.474
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

02:35:27.647 --> 02:35:29.581
Where was Gon...?

02:35:32.251 --> 02:35:34.151
No, my Lord Aragorn...

02:35:35.755 --> 02:35:38.223
we are alone.

02:35:45.098 --> 02:35:46.827
Get the women and children into the caves.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.262
We need more time to lay provisions...

02:35:48.434 --> 02:35:51.926
There is no time. War is upon us.

02:35:52.205 --> 02:35:53.900
Secure the gate.

02:35:59.112 --> 02:36:01.205
We Ents have not troubled...

02:36:01.414 --> 02:36:04.781
about the wars of Men and wizards...

02:36:05.551 --> 02:36:08.543
for a very long time.

02:36:09.822 --> 02:36:14.589
But now, something is about to happen...

02:36:14.761 --> 02:36:17.093
that has not happened...

02:36:17.296 --> 02:36:19.764
for an age.

02:36:20.967 --> 02:36:23.231
Entmoot.

02:36:23.669 --> 02:36:24.658
What's that?

02:36:25.071 --> 02:36:27.904
'Tis a gathering.

02:36:29.108 --> 02:36:31.668
A gathering of what?

02:36:49.629 --> 02:36:51.995
Beech. Oak.

02:36:52.165 --> 02:36:54.065
Chestnut. Ash.

02:36:54.333 --> 02:36:56.301
Good. Good. Good.

02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:58.835
Many have come.

02:37:06.379 --> 02:37:09.143
Now we must decide if the Ents...

02:37:09.315 --> 02:37:11.875
will go to war.

02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:23.920
Move back! Move to the caves!

02:37:26.399 --> 02:37:28.458
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

02:37:28.868 --> 02:37:31.166
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

02:37:31.337 --> 02:37:33.567
They can support the archers from above the gate.

02:37:33.739 --> 02:37:36.867
Aragorn, you must rest.

02:37:37.043 --> 02:37:39.443
You're no use to us half alive.

02:37:39.912 --> 02:37:41.106
Aragorn!

02:37:44.517 --> 02:37:47.543
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

02:37:47.753 --> 02:37:49.380
That is an honorable charge.

02:37:49.589 --> 02:37:52.456
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

02:37:52.625 --> 02:37:54.320
What renown is there in that?

02:37:54.494 --> 02:37:58.191
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

02:37:58.464 --> 02:38:01.262
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

02:38:01.434 --> 02:38:06.428
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

02:38:06.739 --> 02:38:09.537
You do not command the others to stay!

02:38:09.709 --> 02:38:13.475
They fight beside you because
they would not be parted from you.

02:38:14.647 --> 02:38:16.842
Because they love you.

02:38:23.990 --> 02:38:25.480
I'm sorry.

02:39:31.424 --> 02:39:34.655
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

02:39:35.728 --> 02:39:37.525
These are no soldiers.

02:39:39.799 --> 02:39:43.257
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

02:39:47.206 --> 02:39:50.107
Look at them. They're frightened.

02:39:50.276 --> 02:39:51.743
I can see it in their eyes.

02:39:56.500 --> 02:39:58.500
And they should be...

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.500
Three hundred... against ten thousand!

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:06.000
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras...

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.500
Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:12.250
They are all going to die!

02:40:12.732 --> 02:40:14.927
Then I shall die as one of them!

02:40:21.374 --> 02:40:23.205
Let him go, lad.

02:40:23.776 --> 02:40:25.744
Let him be.

02:40:27.213 --> 02:40:32.674
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.

02:40:36.922 --> 02:40:38.822
My lord?

02:40:40.893 --> 02:40:43.453
Who am I, Gamling?

02:40:46.832 --> 02:40:50.734
You are our king, sire.

02:40:53.739 --> 02:40:57.004
And do you trust your king?

02:40:58.544 --> 02:41:01.707
Your men, my lord...

02:41:01.881 --> 02:41:04.679
will follow you to whatever end.

02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:13.490
To whatever end.

02:41:23.336 --> 02:41:26.897
Where is the horse and the rider?

02:41:27.073 --> 02:41:30.133
Where is the horn that was blowing?

02:41:31.644 --> 02:41:36.013
They have passed like rain on the mountains.

02:41:37.016 --> 02:41:40.247
Like wind in the meadow.

02:41:43.956 --> 02:41:47.722
The days have gone down in the West...

02:41:48.427 --> 02:41:51.055
behind the hills...

02:41:52.965 --> 02:41:54.592
into Shadow.

02:42:03.042 --> 02:42:06.478
How did it come to this?

02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:29.665
It's been going for hours.

02:42:30.803 --> 02:42:33.169
They must have decided something by now.

02:42:33.339 --> 02:42:37.435
Decided? No.

02:42:37.610 --> 02:42:42.741
We only just finished saying...

02:42:43.949 --> 02:42:45.814
good morning.

02:42:47.186 --> 02:42:50.349
But it's nighttime already.

02:42:50.556 --> 02:42:52.353
You can't take forever.

02:42:53.359 --> 02:42:55.384
Don't be hasty.

02:42:55.861 --> 02:42:58.261
We're running out of time!

02:43:01.267 --> 02:43:04.236
Move! Move to the outer wall.

02:43:21.821 --> 02:43:23.118
Give me your sword.

02:43:32.631 --> 02:43:33.757
What is your name?

02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:36.666
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

02:43:38.804 --> 02:43:41.432
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

02:43:43.409 --> 02:43:45.377
They say that it is hopeless.

02:44:03.229 --> 02:44:04.856
This is a good sword.

02:44:06.899 --> 02:44:09.231
Haleth, son of Hama...

02:44:13.572 --> 02:44:15.733
there is always hope.

02:44:38.664 --> 02:44:42.031
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

02:44:42.201 --> 02:44:43.759
Forgive me.

02:44:43.936 --> 02:44:45.369
I was wrong to despair.

02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:50.200
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:57.378
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

02:45:00.853 --> 02:45:02.878
It's a little tight across the chest.

02:45:09.094 --> 02:45:11.062
That is no Orc horn.

02:45:16.735 --> 02:45:18.566
Send for the king.

02:45:18.737 --> 02:45:22.332
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

02:45:53.973 --> 02:45:55.634
How is this possible?

02:45:56.642 --> 02:46:00.271
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

02:46:00.446 --> 02:46:03.677
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

02:46:04.383 --> 02:46:08.615
Long ago we fought and died together.

02:46:10.923 --> 02:46:13.824
We come to honor that allegiance.

02:46:22.301 --> 02:46:24.235
You are most welcome.

02:46:29.608 --> 02:46:33.544
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

02:47:07.212 --> 02:47:10.477
You could have picked a better spot.

02:47:15.387 --> 02:47:19.551
Well, lad, whatever luck you live
by, let's hope it lasts the night.

02:47:25.731 --> 02:47:27.528
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

02:47:28.167 --> 02:47:30.658
Let's hope they last the night.

02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:33.500
Show them no mercy...

02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:37.800
for you shall receive none!

02:49:12.070 --> 02:49:14.868
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

02:49:16.141 --> 02:49:17.938
Or would you like me to find you a box?

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
HOLD!

02:50:21.139 --> 02:50:22.936
So it begins.

02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:30.500
Prepare to fire!

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Their armour is weak at the neck...

02:50:40.500 --> 02:50:42.500
and beneath the arm.

02:50:42.750 --> 02:50:44.750
Release Arrows!

02:50:49.768 --> 02:50:51.133
Did they hit anything?

02:50:51.803 --> 02:50:53.794
Give them a volley.

02:50:53.972 --> 02:50:56.065
- Fire!
- Fire!

02:51:11.823 --> 02:51:13.518
Send them to me! Come on!

02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:34.500
Ladders!

02:51:34.212 --> 02:51:35.304
Good!

02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:45.089
Swords! Swords!

02:52:23.228 --> 02:52:25.355
Legolas! Two already!

02:52:25.530 --> 02:52:27.657
I'm on 17!

02:52:27.833 --> 02:52:30.393
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

02:52:37.142 --> 02:52:38.871
Nineteen!

02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:06.303
Merry.

02:53:10.709 --> 02:53:14.509
We have just agreed.

02:53:24.556 --> 02:53:26.023
Yes?

02:53:27.526 --> 02:53:31.690
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

02:53:32.831 --> 02:53:35.994
and we have agreed...

02:53:36.468 --> 02:53:40.495
you are not Orcs.

02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:44.367
Well, that's good news.

02:53:44.543 --> 02:53:48.673
And what about Saruman? Have
you come to a decision about him?

02:53:49.314 --> 02:53:53.114
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

02:53:53.285 --> 02:53:54.809
Hasty?

02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:57.520
Our friends are out there.

02:53:57.689 --> 02:54:01.853
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

02:54:02.194 --> 02:54:04.458
War? Yes.

02:54:04.629 --> 02:54:06.529
It affects us all.

02:54:06.698 --> 02:54:09.690
Tree, root and twig.

02:54:10.569 --> 02:54:14.596
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

02:54:14.806 --> 02:54:16.740
it takes a long time...

02:54:16.908 --> 02:54:21.811
to say anything in Old Entish...

02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:26.212
and we never say anything...

02:54:26.384 --> 02:54:30.320
unless it is worth taking...

02:54:30.489 --> 02:54:34.448
a long time to say.

02:54:35.260 --> 02:54:38.559
Seventeen! Eighteen!

02:54:38.730 --> 02:54:39.788
Nineteen!

02:54:40.365 --> 02:54:42.230
Twenty!

02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.061
Twenty-one!

02:54:54.146 --> 02:54:56.137
Causeway!

02:55:03.955 --> 02:55:06.321
Is this it?

02:55:06.491 --> 02:55:09.426
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

02:55:35.500 --> 02:55:37.500
Bring him down, Legolas!

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Kill him!

02:55:41.500 --> 02:55:43.000
Kill him!

02:56:35.413 --> 02:56:36.778
Brace the gate!

02:56:55.133 --> 02:56:57.397
Hold them! Stand firm!

02:57:05.277 --> 02:57:06.608
Aragorn!

02:57:11.249 --> 02:57:12.443
Gimli!

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
Charge!

02:58:01.199 --> 02:58:05.135
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

02:58:05.904 --> 02:58:09.931
We must weather such things as we have always done.

02:58:10.742 --> 02:58:12.835
How can that be your decision?!

02:58:13.511 --> 02:58:17.140
This is not our war.

02:58:17.449 --> 02:58:19.644
But you're part of this world!

02:58:23.822 --> 02:58:25.653
Aren't you?!

02:58:29.728 --> 02:58:32.094
You must help. Please.

02:58:33.331 --> 02:58:36.095
You must do something.

02:58:36.368 --> 02:58:40.668
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

02:58:41.873 --> 02:58:45.604
But your part in this tale is over.

02:58:45.777 --> 02:58:48.007
Go back to your home.

02:58:58.056 --> 02:59:00.320
Maybe Treebeard's right.

02:59:00.492 --> 02:59:02.357
We don't belong here, Merry.

02:59:02.527 --> 02:59:04.791
It's too big for us.

02:59:04.963 --> 02:59:07.625
What can we do in the end?

02:59:09.934 --> 02:59:12.562
We've got the Shire.

02:59:13.104 --> 02:59:15.629
Maybe we should go home.

02:59:17.475 --> 02:59:20.706
The fires of Isengard will spread...

02:59:20.879 --> 02:59:25.782
and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:27.542
And...

02:59:29.387 --> 02:59:32.413
And all that was once green and
good in this world will be gone.

02:59:35.927 --> 02:59:38.862
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

02:59:58.383 --> 02:59:59.611
Aragorn!

02:59:59.784 --> 03:00:02.150
Fall back to the Keep!

03:00:02.353 --> 03:00:05.413
Get your men out of there!

03:00:06.500 --> 03:00:08.500
To the Keep!

03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:14.500
Pull back to the Keep!

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:16.250
Haldir!

03:00:15.099 --> 03:00:16.760
Haldir!

03:00:17.500 --> 03:00:20.500
To the Keep!

03:00:20.872 --> 03:00:24.137
What are you doing? What are you stopping for?

03:00:43.328 --> 03:00:44.556
Haldir!

03:01:27.272 --> 03:01:28.762
Brace the gate!

03:01:31.009 --> 03:01:32.306
Hold them!

03:01:34.078 --> 03:01:37.445
To the gate. Draw your swords!

03:02:05.610 --> 03:02:07.544
Make way!

03:02:10.448 --> 03:02:12.177
We cannot hold much longer!

03:02:18.189 --> 03:02:21.716
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

03:02:21.926 --> 03:02:24.486
As long as you can give me.

03:02:24.662 --> 03:02:26.323
Gimli!

03:02:27.799 --> 03:02:29.164
Timbers!

03:02:29.334 --> 03:02:31.302
Brace the gate!

03:02:46.017 --> 03:02:47.712
Come on. We can take them.

03:02:48.586 --> 03:02:50.178
It's a long way.

03:02:55.460 --> 03:02:57.223
Toss me.

03:02:58.396 --> 03:03:00.227
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

03:03:00.398 --> 03:03:01.956
You'll have to toss me!

03:03:07.572 --> 03:03:08.834
Don't tell the Elf.

03:03:09.374 --> 03:03:11.137
Not a word.

03:03:26.424 --> 03:03:27.857
Shore up the door!

03:03:28.026 --> 03:03:30.119
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

03:03:30.294 --> 03:03:31.352
Watch our backs!

03:03:35.433 --> 03:03:37.663
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

03:04:27.652 --> 03:04:29.051
Hold fast the gate!

03:04:33.257 --> 03:04:36.192
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

03:04:40.932 --> 03:04:42.524
Aragorn!

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.434
Pull everybody back.

03:05:18.803 --> 03:05:20.600
Pull them back.

03:05:21.139 --> 03:05:22.606
Fall back!

03:05:22.774 --> 03:05:25.265
Fall back!

03:05:26.444 --> 03:05:28.139
They have broken through!

03:05:28.312 --> 03:05:30.576
The castle is breached. Retreat!

03:05:30.748 --> 03:05:32.978
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

03:05:33.084 --> 03:05:35.678
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

03:05:35.887 --> 03:05:38.117
Into the Keep!

03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:54.560
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

03:05:54.739 --> 03:05:59.438
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

03:06:05.183 --> 03:06:06.445
Wait! Stop!

03:06:07.351 --> 03:06:08.841
Stop!

03:06:11.989 --> 03:06:13.684
Turn around.

03:06:14.625 --> 03:06:17.321
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

03:06:17.495 --> 03:06:22.489
But that will lead you past Isengard.

03:06:22.834 --> 03:06:25.530
Yes. Exactly.

03:06:25.703 --> 03:06:28.934
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

03:06:29.106 --> 03:06:31.768
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

03:06:31.943 --> 03:06:33.934
It's the last thing he'll expect.

03:06:36.547 --> 03:06:39.573
That doesn't make sense to me.

03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:40.910
But then...

03:06:41.118 --> 03:06:43.780
you are very small.

03:06:44.288 --> 03:06:46.017
Perhaps you're right.

03:06:48.693 --> 03:06:50.183
South it is, then.

03:06:51.729 --> 03:06:55.062
Hold on, little Shirelings.

03:06:57.101 --> 03:06:59.865
I always like going south.

03:07:00.037 --> 03:07:04.337
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

03:07:04.942 --> 03:07:07.410
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

03:07:07.578 --> 03:07:09.512
No, we won't.

03:07:10.248 --> 03:07:12.512
Not this time.

03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:20.179
Look!

03:07:21.859 --> 03:07:24.293
Osgiliath burns!

03:07:24.462 --> 03:07:25.895
Mordor has come.

03:07:27.031 --> 03:07:29.431
The Ring will not save Gondor.

03:07:30.768 --> 03:07:32.963
It has only the power to destroy.

03:07:33.804 --> 03:07:35.237
Please...

03:07:35.406 --> 03:07:37.033
let me go.

03:07:38.075 --> 03:07:39.667
Hurry.

03:07:43.147 --> 03:07:44.546
Faramir!

03:07:44.715 --> 03:07:47.206
You must let me go!

03:07:47.652 --> 03:07:51.110
And those little family of field mice...

03:07:51.289 --> 03:07:54.122
that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

03:07:54.859 --> 03:07:58.158
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

03:08:09.340 --> 03:08:12.275
Many of these trees were my friends.

03:08:12.977 --> 03:08:17.607
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

03:08:18.783 --> 03:08:19.977
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

03:08:20.151 --> 03:08:22.915
They had voices of their own.

03:08:25.189 --> 03:08:27.714
Saruman.

03:08:28.092 --> 03:08:31.152
A wizard should know better!

03:08:45.376 --> 03:08:49.005
There is no curse in Elvish...

03:08:49.213 --> 03:08:51.875
Entish or the tongues of Men...

03:08:52.049 --> 03:08:54.381
for this treachery.

03:08:55.820 --> 03:08:58.653
Look! The trees! They're moving!

03:09:03.361 --> 03:09:04.555
Where are they going?

03:09:05.096 --> 03:09:08.327
They have business with the Orcs.

03:09:08.799 --> 03:09:13.065
My business is with Isengard tonight...

03:09:13.237 --> 03:09:15.865
with rock and stone.

03:09:39.764 --> 03:09:40.890
Yes.

03:09:41.999 --> 03:09:43.432
Come, my friends.

03:09:44.769 --> 03:09:48.967
The Ents are going to war.

03:09:49.140 --> 03:09:50.903
It is likely...

03:09:51.075 --> 03:09:54.602
that we go to our doom.

03:09:56.013 --> 03:09:58.481
Last march...

03:09:59.016 --> 03:10:01.041
of the Ents.

03:10:49.166 --> 03:10:52.897
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

03:10:53.070 --> 03:10:55.129
By nightfall we will be overrun.

03:10:57.908 --> 03:10:59.375
Mr. Frodo?

03:10:59.677 --> 03:11:03.773
It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.

03:11:03.948 --> 03:11:06.439
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

03:11:20.798 --> 03:11:22.197
Take them to my father.

03:11:23.767 --> 03:11:26.759
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

03:11:29.173 --> 03:11:32.199
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

03:11:33.310 --> 03:11:36.006
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

03:11:36.647 --> 03:11:39.411
You want to know why your brother died?

03:11:39.917 --> 03:11:43.648
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

03:11:43.854 --> 03:11:45.754
He tried to kill him!

03:11:45.923 --> 03:11:48.255
The Ring drove your brother mad!

03:11:49.026 --> 03:11:50.891
Watch out!

03:12:01.805 --> 03:12:02.931
Mr. Frodo?

03:12:05.576 --> 03:12:07.407
They're here.

03:12:10.514 --> 03:12:12.982
They've come.

03:12:15.586 --> 03:12:17.486
Nazgul!

03:12:39.543 --> 03:12:41.704
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

03:12:43.514 --> 03:12:45.744
Take cover!

03:13:03.100 --> 03:13:04.658
The fortress is taken.

03:13:05.436 --> 03:13:06.630
It is over.

03:13:06.804 --> 03:13:10.740
You said this fortress would never
fall while your men defend it.

03:13:10.908 --> 03:13:13.843
They still defend it. They have died defending it.

03:13:16.580 --> 03:13:17.979
They're breaking in!

03:13:20.618 --> 03:13:23.109
They're past the door!

03:13:26.490 --> 03:13:30.620
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

03:13:33.230 --> 03:13:35.164
Is there no other way?

03:13:36.734 --> 03:13:39.794
There is one passage. It leads into the mountains.

03:13:40.471 --> 03:13:42.666
But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

03:13:47.544 --> 03:13:49.944
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

03:13:50.114 --> 03:13:52.981
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

03:13:55.185 --> 03:13:58.586
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

03:14:03.260 --> 03:14:04.693
Ride out with me.

03:14:08.799 --> 03:14:10.426
Ride out and meet them.

03:14:11.201 --> 03:14:13.362
For death and glory.

03:14:13.537 --> 03:14:14.936
For Rohan.

03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:17.907
For your people.

03:14:18.642 --> 03:14:20.576
The sun is rising.

03:14:25.082 --> 03:14:28.074
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

03:14:28.252 --> 03:14:29.651
At dawn...

03:14:29.853 --> 03:14:31.514
look to the east.

03:14:35.693 --> 03:14:37.320
Yes.

03:14:39.797 --> 03:14:41.458
Yes.

03:14:42.800 --> 03:14:45.200
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

03:14:45.369 --> 03:14:48.167
shall sound in the Deep...

03:14:48.605 --> 03:14:50.596
one last time.

03:14:50.774 --> 03:14:52.264
Yes!

03:14:55.312 --> 03:14:59.112
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

03:15:06.924 --> 03:15:08.255
Fell deeds, awake.

03:15:09.460 --> 03:15:10.518
Now for wrath...

03:15:10.728 --> 03:15:14.129
now for ruin and a red dawn.

03:15:21.171 --> 03:15:23.435
Forth Eorlingas!

03:16:11.221 --> 03:16:12.415
Gandalf.

03:16:19.730 --> 03:16:23.393
Theoden King stands alone.

03:16:24.001 --> 03:16:26.162
Not alone.

03:16:26.570 --> 03:16:27.696
Rohirrim!

03:16:33.610 --> 03:16:34.770
Eomer.

03:16:34.945 --> 03:16:37.470
To the king!

03:17:55.125 --> 03:17:56.888
Yes!

03:18:06.036 --> 03:18:09.472
A hit. A fine hit.

03:18:33.997 --> 03:18:36.465
Break the dam!

03:18:36.633 --> 03:18:40.069
Release the river!

03:19:07.431 --> 03:19:10.161
Pippin! Hold on!

03:19:15.439 --> 03:19:18.374
Hold on, little Hobbits.

03:19:59.683 --> 03:20:01.708
What are you doing?

03:20:10.327 --> 03:20:11.851
Where are you going?

03:21:10.053 --> 03:21:11.350
It's me.

03:21:13.890 --> 03:21:16.085
It's your Sam.

03:21:20.430 --> 03:21:23.058
Don't you know your Sam?

03:21:40.717 --> 03:21:44.084
I can't do this, Sam.

03:21:45.021 --> 03:21:46.989
I know.

03:21:48.024 --> 03:21:50.390
It's all wrong.

03:21:51.128 --> 03:21:53.153
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

03:22:00.570 --> 03:22:02.663
But we are.

03:22:09.079 --> 03:22:12.105
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

03:22:12.282 --> 03:22:14.682
The ones that really mattered.

03:22:15.719 --> 03:22:18.711
Full of darkness and danger they were.

03:22:18.922 --> 03:22:21.891
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...

03:22:22.058 --> 03:22:24.993
because how could the end be happy?

03:22:27.564 --> 03:22:29.759
How could the world go back to the way it was...

03:22:29.933 --> 03:22:33.369
when so much bad had happened?

03:22:34.204 --> 03:22:36.104
Victory!

03:22:36.273 --> 03:22:37.831
We have victory!

03:22:38.008 --> 03:22:41.944
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

03:22:42.112 --> 03:22:43.443
this shadow.

03:22:43.613 --> 03:22:46.013
Even darkness must pass.

03:22:46.183 --> 03:22:48.879
A new day will come.

03:22:49.085 --> 03:22:53.021
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

03:22:54.958 --> 03:22:57.324
Those were the stories that stayed with you...

03:22:57.494 --> 03:22:59.257
that meant something.

03:22:59.429 --> 03:23:01.989
Even if you were too small to understand why.

03:23:03.366 --> 03:23:07.234
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

03:23:07.404 --> 03:23:08.962
I know now.

03:23:09.806 --> 03:23:12.001
Folk in those stories...

03:23:12.175 --> 03:23:16.305
had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

03:23:16.479 --> 03:23:18.709
They kept going...

03:23:19.382 --> 03:23:22.647
because they were holding on to something.

03:23:24.287 --> 03:23:26.585
What are we holding on to, Sam?

03:23:38.468 --> 03:23:42.404
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

03:23:42.672 --> 03:23:45.300
And it's worth fighting for.

03:24:12.235 --> 03:24:16.535
I think at last we understand
one another, Frodo Baggins.

03:24:17.274 --> 03:24:21.233
You know the laws of our
country, the laws of your father.

03:24:21.411 --> 03:24:23.606
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

03:24:27.984 --> 03:24:29.383
Then it is forfeit.

03:24:32.155 --> 03:24:33.850
Release them.

03:24:45.936 --> 03:24:47.995
Stay out of the forest!

03:24:48.171 --> 03:24:49.968
Keep away from the trees!

03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:42.587
Final count...

03:25:42.759 --> 03:25:45.660
- 42.
- 42?

03:25:47.130 --> 03:25:51.897
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

03:25:52.702 --> 03:25:56.365
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

03:26:00.477 --> 03:26:03.776
- 43.
- He was already dead.

03:26:04.547 --> 03:26:07.038
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

03:26:07.217 --> 03:26:11.916
because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

03:26:14.157 --> 03:26:18.856
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

03:26:19.129 --> 03:26:22.656
Still, I suppose the view would
be quite nice from up there.

03:26:22.832 --> 03:26:25.801
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

03:26:25.969 --> 03:26:28.802
I hear the staff are very good.

03:26:34.477 --> 03:26:36.843
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

03:26:37.013 --> 03:26:41.279
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

03:26:41.451 --> 03:26:42.679
I'm starving.

03:26:42.886 --> 03:26:45.946
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

03:26:46.156 --> 03:26:49.182
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

03:27:13.183 --> 03:27:15.583
Saruman's storeroom!

03:27:17.954 --> 03:27:20.650
I don't believe it.

03:27:20.857 --> 03:27:22.882
It can't be.

03:27:23.526 --> 03:27:26.427
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

03:27:27.730 --> 03:27:30.028
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:33.426
It's perfect. One barrel each.

03:27:33.603 --> 03:27:34.729
Wait.

03:27:35.472 --> 03:27:36.700
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

03:27:36.873 --> 03:27:38.397
Share it?

03:27:40.243 --> 03:27:42.643
No. No.

03:27:44.147 --> 03:27:45.478
Dead plant and all that.

03:27:45.915 --> 03:27:48.076
Don't think he'd understand.

03:27:49.385 --> 03:27:51.546
Could be a distant relative.

03:27:52.355 --> 03:27:54.846
I get it.

03:27:55.058 --> 03:27:57.856
Don't be hasty.

03:27:58.962 --> 03:28:00.725
Exactly.

03:28:01.798 --> 03:28:04.062
Bar-hrum.

03:28:29.726 --> 03:28:31.023
This is the old sewer.

03:28:31.194 --> 03:28:34.254
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

03:28:34.430 --> 03:28:36.159
You'll find cover in the woods there.

03:28:37.233 --> 03:28:39.701
Captain Faramir...

03:28:40.336 --> 03:28:42.167
you have shown your quality, sir.

03:28:44.674 --> 03:28:45.971
The very highest.

03:28:46.476 --> 03:28:49.104
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

03:28:49.279 --> 03:28:52.214
where gardeners are held in high honor.

03:28:53.416 --> 03:28:55.384
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

03:28:56.019 --> 03:28:57.543
Gollum says there's a path...

03:28:57.754 --> 03:29:01.690
near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

03:29:02.158 --> 03:29:03.887
Cirith Ungol?

03:29:07.430 --> 03:29:09.990
- Is that its name?
- No.

03:29:10.166 --> 03:29:11.827
No!

03:29:12.669 --> 03:29:15.661
- Yes.
- Frodo...

03:29:16.039 --> 03:29:19.566
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

03:29:20.476 --> 03:29:23.001
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

03:29:23.346 --> 03:29:29.615
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

03:29:31.154 --> 03:29:32.917
I must.

03:29:36.459 --> 03:29:40.020
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.

03:29:40.196 --> 03:29:42.221
Thank you.

03:29:54.043 --> 03:29:58.173
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

03:30:10.660 --> 03:30:12.184
Come on, keep up.

03:30:15.665 --> 03:30:18.463
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

03:30:19.102 --> 03:30:20.933
You know that, don't you?

03:30:21.738 --> 03:30:23.296
He was trying to save you, see?

03:30:23.806 --> 03:30:25.330
Save me?

03:30:25.675 --> 03:30:27.836
So there's no hard feelings.

03:30:28.011 --> 03:30:33.074
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

03:30:33.249 --> 03:30:35.877
Gollum, Gollum.

03:30:36.953 --> 03:30:38.682
Yes, master.

03:30:39.789 --> 03:30:42.622
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

03:30:42.792 --> 03:30:45.090
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

03:30:50.600 --> 03:30:55.799
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

03:31:02.945 --> 03:31:05.937
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

03:31:06.616 --> 03:31:10.143
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

03:31:15.325 --> 03:31:18.761
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

03:31:19.729 --> 03:31:22.960
somewhere in the wilderness.

03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:29.670
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

03:31:29.839 --> 03:31:31.204
What?

03:31:31.374 --> 03:31:35.276
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

03:31:35.445 --> 03:31:38.710
And they'll say, "Yes! That's
one of my favorite stories."

03:31:38.881 --> 03:31:41.816
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

03:31:41.984 --> 03:31:43.645
"Yes, my boy.

03:31:43.853 --> 03:31:47.653
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

03:31:47.824 --> 03:31:50.315
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

03:31:50.526 --> 03:31:52.426
"Samwise the Brave."

03:31:52.595 --> 03:31:55.325
I want to hear more about Sam.

03:31:59.635 --> 03:32:02.627
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

03:32:03.973 --> 03:32:08.000
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't
make fun. I was being serious.

03:32:09.112 --> 03:32:10.477
So was I.

03:32:19.389 --> 03:32:22.051
"Samwise the Brave."

03:32:26.362 --> 03:32:27.693
Smeagol?

03:32:27.864 --> 03:32:30.765
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

03:32:30.933 --> 03:32:32.867
Master.

03:32:33.035 --> 03:32:35.936
Master looks after us.

03:32:36.706 --> 03:32:39.504
Master wouldn't hurt us.

03:32:39.675 --> 03:32:42.143
Master broke his promise.

03:32:42.311 --> 03:32:44.472
Don't ask Smeagol.

03:32:44.647 --> 03:32:47.844
Poor, poor Smeagol.

03:32:48.017 --> 03:32:50.850
Master betrayed us.

03:32:51.053 --> 03:32:54.113
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

03:32:54.323 --> 03:32:58.225
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

03:32:58.394 --> 03:33:01.124
Kill him! Kill him!

03:33:01.297 --> 03:33:02.787
Kill them both!

03:33:02.965 --> 03:33:06.594
And then we take the precious...

03:33:06.769 --> 03:33:10.296
and we be the master!

03:33:10.973 --> 03:33:13.635
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

03:33:13.810 --> 03:33:16.472
Eyes always watching.

03:33:16.646 --> 03:33:20.207
Then we stabs them out.

03:33:20.383 --> 03:33:24.877
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

03:33:25.087 --> 03:33:28.523
Yes. Yes. Yes.

03:33:28.724 --> 03:33:31.420
Kill them both.

03:33:31.594 --> 03:33:33.994
Yes. No! No!

03:33:34.197 --> 03:33:37.894
It's too risky. It's too risky.

03:33:38.601 --> 03:33:41.195
Where is he? Where has he gone?

03:33:41.370 --> 03:33:43.964
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

03:33:44.140 --> 03:33:49.544
We could let her do it.

03:33:50.513 --> 03:33:54.643
Yes. She could do it.

03:33:54.817 --> 03:33:59.379
Yes, precious, she could.

03:33:59.589 --> 03:34:05.585
And then we takes it once they're dead.

03:34:06.562 --> 03:34:09.395
Once they're dead.

03:34:13.803 --> 03:34:17.500
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

03:34:17.673 --> 03:34:19.732
Smeagol will show you the way.

03:34:19.909 --> 03:34:22.139
Follow me.
