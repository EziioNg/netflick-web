03:55.560 --> 03:57.650
I think...

03:59.490 --> 04:02.020
I think I found you one.

04:05.070 --> 04:08.590
Look, I called you, right?

04:09.440 --> 04:15.000
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.990
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

04:33.360 --> 04:35.060
It's okay.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.950
This is Constantine.

05:31.120 --> 05:36.220
John Constantine, asshole.

05:43.730 --> 05:45.760
Sure.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.920
What the hell?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.030
I need a mirror.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.210
Now. At least 3 feet high.

06:32.380 --> 06:35.040
Move! Go, now!

06:48.960 --> 06:50.930
This is Kramer.

06:51.530 --> 06:54.500
Chas Kramer, asshole.

06:54.670 --> 06:56.360
Asshole.

06:56.540 --> 07:01.740
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

07:01.910 --> 07:04.040
- Chas!
- What?

07:04.210 --> 07:06.940
- Move the car.
- Why?

07:07.780 --> 07:09.910
Move the damn car!

07:12.950 --> 07:14.350
"Chas, move the car."

07:16.670 --> 07:17.890
There, car's moved.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.030
Lift it up over the bed.

07:32.940 --> 07:37.110
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

07:38.450 --> 07:43.780
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

07:55.830 --> 07:56.990
No!

08:03.940 --> 08:06.240
Show yourself.

08:10.210 --> 08:12.340
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

08:20.890 --> 08:22.050
For your boss.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.330
Pull it!

08:51.820 --> 08:53.720
Ma? Ma?

09:29.920 --> 09:34.090
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

09:34.300 --> 09:35.920
What happened in there?

09:43.570 --> 09:45.600
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.900
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.540
I have to sleep, John.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.740
I need some help, Father.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.040
You do?

09:57.420 --> 09:58.940
From me?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.820
What kind of...?

10:03.190 --> 10:07.250
- Hey, listen, I...
- That exorcism wasn't right.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.090
Listen to the ether.

10:13.170 --> 10:16.690
Anything unusual, you let me know.

10:17.310 --> 10:22.240
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.500
A few days.

10:27.850 --> 10:29.110
Okay.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.690
Okay. For you, John.

10:36.190 --> 10:39.650
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

10:39.890 --> 10:42.490
- I told you to move it.
- You did tell me to move it,

10:42.660 --> 10:46.100
but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon,

10:46.270 --> 10:48.100
I would've moved it further, John.

10:48.470 --> 10:51.930
- Take Alvarado.
- Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

10:53.270 --> 10:56.970
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

10:57.150 --> 10:58.700
- No?
- Nope.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.940
Nope?

11:00.110 --> 11:02.210
Of course it's a nope.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.880
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.150
<i>It's been...</i>

11:47.360 --> 11:50.350
<i>two weeks since my last confession.</i>

11:53.600 --> 11:55.900
I killed a man today.

11:56.970 --> 11:58.700
Another one.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.110
I didn't even see his face, I just...

12:09.120 --> 12:11.550
pulled the trigger, and he went away.

12:12.750 --> 12:18.920
<i>Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.</i>

12:20.190 --> 12:24.190
<i>Why do I always know
where these guys are?</i>

12:24.370 --> 12:27.700
<i>Where to aim, when to fire.</i>

12:29.300 --> 12:32.270
<i>I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?</i>

12:33.440 --> 12:35.100
<i>Something damned?</i>

12:35.280 --> 12:40.610
<i>God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.</i>

12:40.950 --> 12:45.210
<i>You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.</i>

12:45.390 --> 12:47.410
<i>Yeah, I'm trying.</i>

12:48.260 --> 12:50.660
<i>I'm trying real hard.</i>

12:52.590 --> 12:53.580
<i>Isabel.</i>

13:44.610 --> 13:46.810
<i>Isabel.</i>

14:43.400 --> 14:45.740
Things I've beaten.

14:46.140 --> 14:49.600
Things most people never even heard of.

14:49.910 --> 14:53.210
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

14:54.350 --> 14:56.680
Wouldn't be the first, John.

14:58.490 --> 15:00.580
Come on, Les.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.090
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

15:03.260 --> 15:06.160
This is aggressive.

15:07.430 --> 15:10.400
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

15:11.270 --> 15:13.560
Now you don't wanna leave.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.400
Yeah, that's a good idea.

15:19.370 --> 15:21.360
John, you really need to prepare.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.910
- Make arrangements.
- No need.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.240
I already know exactly where I'm going.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.220
- Morning.
- Good morning.

15:38.890 --> 15:41.360
- Good morning.
- Detective.

15:41.530 --> 15:43.360
- No, no, no.
- Angela, wait.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.190
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.860
Give us the room, please.

16:20.070 --> 16:22.130
Isabel.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.140
She fell from the roof?

16:31.310 --> 16:33.140
She jumped.

16:35.350 --> 16:36.910
- No.
- Look...

16:37.080 --> 16:41.210
I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.290
- Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
- Angie.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.230
- She wouldn't kill herself.
- Detective.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.500
- Period.
- Detective.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.300
Period!

17:00.070 --> 17:04.030
Angie, there were security cameras.

17:13.590 --> 17:16.850
- Hold the door. You going down?
- Not if I can help it.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.170
A new case?

18:09.640 --> 18:15.080
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

18:15.320 --> 18:18.290
- Humor me.
- Don't I always?

18:23.360 --> 18:26.880
Oh, yeah, that's...
Much obliged. Thank you.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.590
How you feeling, John?

18:30.870 --> 18:32.420
So, what's new?

18:36.740 --> 18:40.470
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope,

18:40.640 --> 18:44.270
holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan,

18:44.450 --> 18:49.380
and, you'll love this,
screech beetle from Amityville.

18:51.690 --> 18:55.620
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

18:55.790 --> 18:58.920
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

18:59.660 --> 19:01.990
I just like them.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.060
Yeah. Who doesn't?

19:06.200 --> 19:08.260
Yeah, easy there, hero.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.000
- That's dragon's breath.
- I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

19:12.170 --> 19:16.970
Yeah, well, I know a guy
who knows a guy.

19:23.150 --> 19:26.750
So, what's the action?

19:27.290 --> 19:30.990
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.260
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.730
- Yeah, I know how it sounds.
- No, we're finger puppets to them, John,

19:39.900 --> 19:41.300
not doorways.

19:41.470 --> 19:45.600
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

19:45.770 --> 19:48.330
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.410
Sure thing, John.

19:51.510 --> 19:53.170
Anything else?

19:53.350 --> 19:56.440
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a...?

19:58.150 --> 19:59.380
On the house.

20:00.150 --> 20:03.950
All right, question. How much longer
do I have to be your slave, John?

20:05.830 --> 20:08.020
You're not my slave, Chas.

20:08.860 --> 20:11.890
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

20:12.070 --> 20:14.230
Like Tonto or Robin.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.100
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

20:17.270 --> 20:21.170
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.740
John? John.

20:27.010 --> 20:29.680
I love our little talks, John.

20:43.260 --> 20:48.070
- May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?
- No, thanks, I'm not gonna be staying long.

20:48.240 --> 20:52.830
- How about you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.470
I really need to speak with him.
It's important.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.370
First come, first served.

21:01.580 --> 21:04.610
So you're rude no matter where you are.

21:13.330 --> 21:15.230
- Father.
- Hi.

21:16.260 --> 21:19.530
- You have news. Yes.
- Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

21:25.570 --> 21:28.200
I know what you want, son.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.900
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

21:33.410 --> 21:35.470
I'm flattered.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.910
Well, I could offer something

21:39.090 --> 21:43.320
about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock,

21:43.660 --> 21:45.590
but it might sound disingenuous.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.490
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

21:48.660 --> 21:52.890
- Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
- She didn't commit suicide.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.660
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.930
Oh, rules.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.940
Father.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.670
David.

22:03.180 --> 22:05.270
This is Isabel.

22:05.450 --> 22:09.180
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

22:10.150 --> 22:11.810
Please.

22:12.650 --> 22:14.380
I'm sorry.

22:17.290 --> 22:20.750
I've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

22:20.930 --> 22:23.660
You might consider
giving me an extension.

22:23.830 --> 22:26.430
I could do your side some good
these days.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.830
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

22:29.700 --> 22:32.760
What about the minions I've sent back?

22:32.940 --> 22:37.070
- That alone should guarantee my entry.
- How many times have I told you?

22:37.240 --> 22:39.270
That's not the way this works.

22:39.450 --> 22:42.140
Why, haven't I served him enough?

22:43.150 --> 22:46.050
- What does he want from me?
- Only the usual.

22:46.220 --> 22:49.310
Self-sacrifice, belief.

22:49.490 --> 22:52.690
- Oh, I believe, for chrissake.
- No, no, you know.

22:52.860 --> 22:55.410
And there's a difference. You've seen.

22:55.440 --> 22:59.960
I never asked to see.
I was born with this curse.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.190
A gift, John.

23:02.370 --> 23:04.860
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

23:05.040 --> 23:08.570
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.570
Who's that for?

23:11.580 --> 23:15.310
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.710
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

23:17.890 --> 23:20.510
Impossible rules, endless regulations,

23:20.690 --> 23:24.780
who goes up, who goes down and why.

23:29.130 --> 23:31.890
You don't even understand us.

23:32.570 --> 23:35.190
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

23:47.950 --> 23:49.920
Why me, Gabriel?

23:51.320 --> 23:53.750
It's personal, isn't it?

23:54.290 --> 23:59.620
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough,

23:59.960 --> 24:04.260
I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

24:06.270 --> 24:09.000
You are going to die young...

24:09.170 --> 24:13.110
because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.130
And you're going to go to hell...

24:16.610 --> 24:19.370
because of the life you took.

24:24.420 --> 24:26.250
You're fucked.

24:37.930 --> 24:40.300
At least it's nice out.

24:42.870 --> 24:46.170
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

24:52.250 --> 24:55.370
And his punch lines are killers.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.050
John!

25:03.520 --> 25:07.390
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

25:19.770 --> 25:23.610
<i>Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.</i>

25:23.780 --> 25:27.470
<i>So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...</i>

25:27.650 --> 25:33.020
<i>Police report she had been
physically penetrated</i>

25:33.190 --> 25:36.950
<i>over 100 times and buried alive.</i>

25:37.120 --> 25:38.890
<i>...found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs...</i>

25:39.060 --> 25:43.050
<i>He stuffed Holly's body into...</i>

25:43.230 --> 25:46.690
<i>- The bodies ravished by the unknown...
- He used a small handsaw...</i>

25:46.870 --> 25:48.530
<i>Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.</i>

26:12.390 --> 26:14.590
<i>Isabel.</i>

26:15.200 --> 26:16.860
I'm so sorry, lzzy.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.830
<i>Constantine.</i>

26:53.130 --> 26:54.790
Dodson.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.260
Hello?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.500
Hello.

28:06.870 --> 28:07.860
Hello?

28:08.040 --> 28:09.980
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

28:41.140 --> 28:45.100
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

29:07.230 --> 29:11.360
I know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.170
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

29:13.340 --> 29:17.110
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

29:17.280 --> 29:20.040
- You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
- It's a bar?

29:20.210 --> 29:24.580
It's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

29:24.750 --> 29:27.380
- John, the man's a legend.
- Yeah.

29:27.550 --> 29:31.750
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?
I'm begging you, John, please?

29:32.630 --> 29:35.090
- Sure, you can get in.
- I can get in?

29:35.260 --> 29:37.460
If you can get in.

29:38.030 --> 29:41.970
If I can get...? It's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

29:46.010 --> 29:47.670
Two frogs on a bench.

29:52.180 --> 29:53.980
Two frogs on a bench.

29:54.150 --> 29:56.140
No, no, I'm with the guy you just...

29:56.320 --> 29:58.180
John! John!

29:58.350 --> 30:00.340
I'm with him, though.

30:01.490 --> 30:03.460
Rat in a dress.

30:04.290 --> 30:06.990
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.130
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.250
Don't get up.

31:06.390 --> 31:08.950
You've been absent some time.

31:09.160 --> 31:12.130
Have you come here with relics to sell?

31:12.490 --> 31:15.690
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

31:16.630 --> 31:19.720
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

31:19.900 --> 31:21.870
Midnite, Jesus...

31:22.040 --> 31:25.470
I thought the thing was authentic.

31:28.340 --> 31:30.070
I see now.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.580
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

31:33.750 --> 31:35.540
A few months, maybe a year.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.380
I thought I heard thunder last night.

31:38.650 --> 31:41.680
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.990
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.460
So I've heard.

31:49.260 --> 31:55.260
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here
for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.370
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.770
They don't like you, John.

32:03.940 --> 32:05.840
How many have you
deported back to hell?

32:06.010 --> 32:10.540
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.450
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

32:13.620 --> 32:18.320
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon
trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

32:18.490 --> 32:23.550
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven...

32:23.730 --> 32:26.260
The great detente
of the original superpowers.

32:26.470 --> 32:31.340
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.100
Now...

32:35.280 --> 32:36.740
I need to use the chair.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.510
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you,

32:44.680 --> 32:46.410
you know I am neutral.

32:46.590 --> 32:50.820
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

32:51.320 --> 32:54.620
Before you were a bartender...

32:55.200 --> 32:59.150
you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

33:00.030 --> 33:03.060
- And I...
- You were Constantine.

33:03.740 --> 33:06.600
The John Constantine.

33:07.410 --> 33:09.030
Once.

33:10.380 --> 33:13.810
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

33:13.980 --> 33:16.410
Something's coming.

33:17.220 --> 33:18.340
Spooky.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.180
Balthazar.

33:21.350 --> 33:25.450
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

33:25.990 --> 33:27.580
I'll make your night.

33:27.760 --> 33:31.460
I'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

33:33.030 --> 33:37.970
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

33:38.140 --> 33:40.110
Johnny boy.

33:42.540 --> 33:46.740
Word is you're on your way down.

33:47.110 --> 33:49.140
Fresh meat.

33:52.590 --> 33:54.750
Finger-licking good.

33:55.290 --> 33:56.920
We have a meeting now, John.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.230
What? I didn't catch that.

34:50.640 --> 34:53.040
Welcome to my life.

35:02.690 --> 35:03.920
Mr. Constantine.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.460
- I saw you...
- I remember.

35:09.030 --> 35:12.090
- And then I saw you at the...
- Regular kismet.

35:13.300 --> 35:16.790
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

35:16.970 --> 35:20.060
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

35:20.470 --> 35:22.910
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.200
Please?

35:29.350 --> 35:30.980
Always a catch.

35:45.830 --> 35:48.560
My sister was murdered yesterday.

35:48.740 --> 35:51.670
- Sorry to hear.
- Thanks.

35:52.080 --> 35:56.940
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

35:57.610 --> 35:59.540
Thought you said she was murdered.

35:59.710 --> 36:02.740
Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

36:02.920 --> 36:06.550
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

36:07.420 --> 36:09.650
That's just crazy.

36:13.560 --> 36:17.520
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

36:17.700 --> 36:22.900
I know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

36:23.070 --> 36:26.700
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

36:26.870 --> 36:31.610
She started talking about demons,
angels.

36:31.780 --> 36:34.510
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

36:34.680 --> 36:38.480
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

36:38.650 --> 36:43.090
Some kind of legion or cult.

36:43.390 --> 36:46.220
Sounds like a theory, detective.

36:46.390 --> 36:47.830
Good luck.

36:50.160 --> 36:54.530
I thought with your background,
you could at least
point me in the right direction.

36:54.700 --> 36:57.030
Yeah, okay, sure.

37:00.310 --> 37:02.370
It wasn't a suicide.

37:02.540 --> 37:04.700
My sister was a devout Catholic.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.370
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life...

37:07.550 --> 37:10.350
Her soul would go straight to hell...

37:10.520 --> 37:15.650
where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony,

37:15.820 --> 37:19.050
for all eternity. That it?

37:19.230 --> 37:21.250
That about right?

37:28.230 --> 37:30.360
Goddamn you.

38:00.700 --> 38:02.170
Detective.

38:02.340 --> 38:05.200
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager,

38:05.380 --> 38:08.860
a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

38:09.040 --> 38:11.510
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

38:11.680 --> 38:15.980
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

38:16.320 --> 38:20.510
- Just influence. See who would win.
- Okay, I'm humoring you.

38:20.690 --> 38:22.780
- Why?
- Who knows.

38:22.960 --> 38:26.050
- Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
- Oh, so it's fun.

38:26.230 --> 38:31.190
It's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

38:31.360 --> 38:35.130
And you think the devil is responsible?

38:35.300 --> 38:38.070
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

38:38.240 --> 38:41.670
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

38:41.840 --> 38:45.610
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

38:45.780 --> 38:49.270
Well, this has been real educational...

38:49.450 --> 38:51.110
but I don't believe in the devil.

38:51.280 --> 38:54.740
You should. He believes in you.

39:14.870 --> 39:17.070
It's a power outage.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.210
Not likely.

39:21.850 --> 39:25.280
- What?
- We should go. Now.

39:30.390 --> 39:32.380
What is that?

39:33.490 --> 39:35.220
Wings.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.160
Maybe talons.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.190
You're kidding. Of what?

39:42.200 --> 39:45.190
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

39:49.140 --> 39:51.740
That's really not going to help.

39:56.350 --> 39:59.110
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

39:59.290 --> 40:00.510
Suit yourself.

40:23.010 --> 40:26.140
Demons stay in hell, huh?

40:27.510 --> 40:29.570
Tell them that.

40:31.720 --> 40:36.590
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

40:36.820 --> 40:38.880
It's the sulfur.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.450
Sulfur.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.100
What were those things?

40:47.370 --> 40:49.130
Demons.

40:50.840 --> 40:55.330
- Scavengers of the damned.
- No, no. It's impossible.

40:55.510 --> 40:59.310
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

41:01.450 --> 41:04.470
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

41:04.650 --> 41:06.080
Isabel?

41:06.890 --> 41:08.950
Never in a million years.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.420
Well, let's be sure.

41:11.620 --> 41:14.120
Let's see if she's in hell.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.780
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

41:41.250 --> 41:43.420
In front of the chair.

41:46.290 --> 41:48.120
I can't believe I'm doing this.

41:48.290 --> 41:50.920
- These are all Isabel's things?
- Yeah.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.960
- How about the cat?
- Duck?

41:54.730 --> 41:56.730
Yeah, why?

41:57.840 --> 41:59.130
Duck.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.640
Oh, you think that's strange.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.240
Cats are good.

42:03.410 --> 42:05.040
Half in, half out anyway.

42:23.360 --> 42:26.560
If this is some kind of spell
or something,

42:26.730 --> 42:29.900
don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

42:30.070 --> 42:31.370
Why, do you have any?

42:32.710 --> 42:35.670
- This is crazy.
- Yes.

42:39.180 --> 42:41.540
I need you to leave.

42:42.380 --> 42:45.210
- I'm sorry?
- Angela, please.

42:49.520 --> 42:51.510
The apartment.

42:53.530 --> 42:55.360
Okay.

43:01.700 --> 43:04.230
Be careful with that cat.

43:08.370 --> 43:11.070
God, I hate this part.

45:13.900 --> 45:16.700
- Isabel.
- Constantine.

46:02.250 --> 46:03.680
Angela.

46:07.120 --> 46:08.640
Jesus.

46:12.890 --> 46:14.620
- Constantine, what...?
- Twins.

46:14.790 --> 46:16.730
Jesus. What?

46:17.630 --> 46:20.120
- You were twins.
- What did you say?

46:20.300 --> 46:22.960
- She killed herself.
- What?

46:24.100 --> 46:26.730
And she's damned for it.

46:39.690 --> 46:41.450
How is this possible?

46:43.990 --> 46:45.820
I need to eat.

48:33.630 --> 48:36.070
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

48:39.140 --> 48:41.000
Relax, man.

48:41.570 --> 48:43.410
Slow down!

49:06.630 --> 49:09.570
What the hell kind of place is this?

50:00.150 --> 50:01.950
John.

50:32.380 --> 50:36.250
When I was a kid, I could see things.

50:36.760 --> 50:38.810
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

50:40.390 --> 50:43.260
<i>Things you shouldn't have to see.</i>

51:00.880 --> 51:05.180
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

51:05.380 --> 51:07.850
<i>They made it worse.</i>

51:10.320 --> 51:13.090
You think you're crazy long enough,

51:13.630 --> 51:14.890
you find a way out.

51:15.290 --> 51:19.160
<i>- You tried to kill yourself.
- I didn't try anything.</i>

51:22.940 --> 51:26.030
<i>Officially, I was dead for two minutes.</i>

51:26.910 --> 51:29.340
But when you cross over,

51:30.480 --> 51:32.840
time stops.

51:34.250 --> 51:37.110
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

51:39.050 --> 51:41.350
When I came back...

51:43.260 --> 51:45.050
I knew...

51:45.390 --> 51:48.120
all the things I could see were real.

51:49.460 --> 51:54.590
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

51:54.770 --> 51:59.760
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

52:00.010 --> 52:03.460
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

52:03.640 --> 52:06.580
So instead we get
what I call half-breeds.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.940
<i>The influence peddlers.</i>

52:10.120 --> 52:15.580
<i>They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage</i>

52:15.750 --> 52:19.780
<i>or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.</i>

52:19.960 --> 52:22.980
<i>Those with the demon's touch...</i>

52:23.160 --> 52:28.230
<i>like those part angel,
living alongside us.</i>

52:28.400 --> 52:30.890
They call it the balance.

52:31.300 --> 52:34.430
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

52:35.970 --> 52:38.570
So when a half-breed breaks the rules,

52:39.040 --> 52:43.000
I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

52:43.650 --> 52:46.280
I don't get them all...

52:47.450 --> 52:50.720
but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

52:51.760 --> 52:54.750
- retirement.
- I don't understand.

52:56.700 --> 52:58.890
I'm a suicide, Angela.

52:59.060 --> 53:02.630
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.830
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.470
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison

53:07.640 --> 53:10.040
where half the inmates
were put there by you?

53:12.440 --> 53:14.970
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

53:15.380 --> 53:18.510
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

53:18.680 --> 53:20.710
He's not planning anything.

53:21.120 --> 53:23.110
When we were little...

53:24.090 --> 53:26.680
Isabel saw things too.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.560
Dodson.

53:36.140 --> 53:39.590
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

53:39.770 --> 53:42.870
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

53:43.040 --> 53:46.270
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

53:46.880 --> 53:49.510
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

53:51.950 --> 53:53.920
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

53:54.220 --> 53:55.710
He's okay.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.830
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

54:43.570 --> 54:45.200
Yes?

54:46.310 --> 54:47.970
What do you mean?

54:48.910 --> 54:50.400
What?

54:50.580 --> 54:52.100
How?

55:03.620 --> 55:06.750
Got it. Bye.

55:13.270 --> 55:16.260
I need to see where Isabel died.

55:20.210 --> 55:23.800
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.510
She certainly did that.

55:26.710 --> 55:30.240
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

55:30.420 --> 55:34.110
She'd scare my mother half to death.

55:35.920 --> 55:38.580
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

55:38.760 --> 55:41.020
So you had her committed.

55:41.190 --> 55:42.490
Yeah.

55:42.660 --> 55:44.320
How long?

55:44.700 --> 55:46.390
Two weeks.

55:46.930 --> 55:48.660
This time.

55:48.830 --> 55:53.400
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

55:55.410 --> 55:59.040
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand,

55:59.210 --> 56:01.510
does it have something to do with this?

56:01.850 --> 56:04.110
I'm a cop, John, remember?

56:04.280 --> 56:09.220
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

56:09.390 --> 56:14.260
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

56:14.430 --> 56:19.760
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

56:21.300 --> 56:23.130
Something just for you.

56:24.640 --> 56:28.830
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

56:29.010 --> 56:32.340
- I'm not like my sister.
- But you were once.

56:32.510 --> 56:34.710
When you were kids.

56:35.050 --> 56:37.780
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

56:37.950 --> 56:41.720
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

56:41.890 --> 56:43.350
That was a long time ago.

56:43.520 --> 56:47.720
- That kind of bond doesn't just disappear.
- There is nothing here.

56:48.330 --> 56:51.490
- Hey. Come on.
- She planned her death in this room.

56:51.660 --> 56:55.060
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

56:55.230 --> 56:58.460
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw,

56:58.640 --> 57:01.700
feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

57:02.070 --> 57:04.700
- What did she do, Angela?
- How should I know?

57:04.880 --> 57:07.280
- What did she do, Angela?
- I don't know.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.770
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

57:11.950 --> 57:16.720
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

57:16.890 --> 57:20.190
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

57:20.360 --> 57:22.690
- What did she do?
- I don't know!

57:40.380 --> 57:42.570
When we were girls...

57:45.520 --> 57:48.380
we would leave each other messages.

57:51.060 --> 57:52.920
In light.

57:55.530 --> 57:57.320
In breath.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.260
On the windows.

58:06.840 --> 58:10.800
John, there is no 17th act
in Corinthians.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.740
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

58:18.180 --> 58:20.050
They have Bibles in hell.

58:20.620 --> 58:23.110
<i>Paints a different view of Revelations.</i>

58:23.290 --> 58:25.420
<i>Says the world will not end
by God's hand,</i>

58:25.590 --> 58:28.580
<i>but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.</i>

58:28.760 --> 58:30.230
<i>Though if you ask me,</i>

58:30.960 --> 58:32.830
fire's fire.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.260
<i>16:29, 16:30.</i>

58:37.500 --> 58:41.460
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

58:41.640 --> 58:45.510
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son."

58:46.080 --> 58:49.640
- Whose son?
- But he can't cross over, B.

58:49.820 --> 58:52.440
- Impossible to cross over.
- Whose son? God's son?

58:52.620 --> 58:56.050
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

58:56.350 --> 58:57.910
Here it is.

58:58.090 --> 59:00.150
This is the sign of Mammon,

59:00.330 --> 59:04.790
the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here...

59:05.300 --> 59:07.460
<i>- Beeman?</i>
- Yeah.

59:07.630 --> 59:10.620
Sorry, I'm...
I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

59:11.640 --> 59:17.370
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule

59:17.540 --> 59:23.480
and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

59:28.390 --> 59:33.850
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

59:34.030 --> 59:37.650
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

59:37.830 --> 59:40.160
Always a catch.

59:40.570 --> 59:46.870
It says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.670
- Isabel.
<i>- But that wouldn't be enough.</i>

59:50.410 --> 59:54.870
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.450
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:04.420
- The help of God?
<i>- It says...</i>

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.650
<i>- Beeman?</i>
- John, look...

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:19.360
I know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to,

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:23.270
<i>but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith...</i>

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.910
in you.

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:31.710
Beeman? Beeman?

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.740
Drive. Fast.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.840
Beeman!

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:54.970
Sulfur.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.040
Beeman!

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:03.940
Beeman!

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:16.220
Wasn't just Isabel.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.050
I used to see things too.

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:22.820
But...

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:26.860
- you already knew that, didn't you?
- Go home, Angela.

01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.470
I need to understand.

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:31.120
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.400
I'm stronger than Isabel.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:37.530
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:42.480
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:47.310
- I don't need another ghost following me.
- John, they killed my sister.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.010
I'd trade places with her if I could.

01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:59.860
I used to pretend that I didn't.

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:02.930
That I didn't see things.

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.890
And...

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.370
by the time we were 10,
they started forcing her to take

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.200
antipsychotics

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.580
and have treatments.
They would come for her

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:20.480
and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, "Tell them.

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:24.490
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?"

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:26.990
But I lied.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.850
I said:

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.730
"I don't see anything."

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:36.860
Until one day...

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.570
I finally stopped seeing.

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:44.430
I abandoned her, John.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.700
I left her all alone.

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:57.240
I need to see what she saw.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.810
Please.

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:08.890
You do this, there's no turning back.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.790
You see them,

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.630
they see you.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.490
Understand?

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:20.930
Yeah.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.940
Sure.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.010
So do I have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.090
John?

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.330
I'm thinking.

01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:27.960
John?

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.630
On is fine.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.810
- So why water?
- It's a universal conduit.

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:51.060
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:55.490
- Now ask me if there's water in hell.
- Is there water in hell?

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:58.770
Sit.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:04.400
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended,

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.010
but you wanted the crash course.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.880
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.140
So...

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:16.610
So, what's gonna happen?

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:18.450
Lie down.

01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:22.590
- What do you mean lie down?
- You have to be fully submerged.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.060
For how long?

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.530
As long as it takes.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.730
Take a deep one.

01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:25.310
Oh, God.

01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:29.110
Oh, God, all those people.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:32.150
Oh, Isabel.

01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:33.950
I've always known.

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:38.650
I've always known where they are.
I've always known where to find them...

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:41.960
where to aim and where to duck

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:46.330
and I've always known
where they were.
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.030
Always known that it wasn't luck.
I've always known...

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:52.400
I've always known that I could see.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:57.880
I've always known that I could see.

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.510
Angela.

01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:10.760
Someone was here.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.640
It was his.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.820
Rolling.

01:09:43.890 --> 01:09:45.830
Not a ball.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.460
Something smaller.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.860
Shiny.

01:10:26.670 --> 01:10:28.930
Balthazar.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.800
Sorry.

01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:12.210
Can you just kill him?

01:11:13.150 --> 01:11:14.480
What about the balance?

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:18.310
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

01:11:18.490 --> 01:11:20.960
I'm just adding some counterweight.

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:56.880
John, I really want...

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.090
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.800
I'm coming with you.

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:19.580
You're staying in the car.

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:46.880
Fire? I was born of this.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.580
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:59.040
That's better. Au naturel.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.390
"Stay in the car."

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.930
"Wait here."

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:12.960
Men.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.120
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.710
Enjoy it.

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:08.950
We'll see you very soon.

01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:11.220
Not really, no.

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:16.560
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:18.260
True.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.730
But you're not.

01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:24.160
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading you your last rites.

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.000
Spare me your remedial incantations.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.510
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.240
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:35.810
Demon in heaven.

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:39.450
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:43.850
You're not a priest. You have no power.

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:50.490
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over and you can go back
to your shithole.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:56.690
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.820
"May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:16.830
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven."

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.660
- How? How's he doing it?
- No.

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:23.060
No, I can't.

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:28.300
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom,

01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:33.910
in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:36.140
Amen!

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:42.310
The blood of God.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.750
He found it.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.180
Whatever killed the son of God

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:53.890
will give birth to the son of the devil.

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:57.860
By the way,

01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:03.770
you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven...

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.970
asshole.

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.340
My work here is done.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.550
- What are you laughing at?
- She was my only mission

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:23.920
and you brought her right to us.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.230
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.700
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:37.000
The Spear of Destiny.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.140
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the Crucifixion story.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:53.890
I drew out the sister as you asked.

01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:59.650
She's been made flush and ready.

01:16:59.830 --> 01:17:03.600
So much power.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:09.100
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
I shall serve.

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:15.200
Wait. But I did as we agreed.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.010
No. Please. No!

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:26.850
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:31.420
How's the blood of God's only son?

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:34.090
The stains on the spear.

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:38.270
- Yeah.
- So he gets the spear.

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.600
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:43.260
Not really.

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:47.670
Twins.

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.240
Where's the amulet?

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:55.610
I don't know,
I must have left it in the...

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.580
What's wrong?

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.850
I don't know, I just feel...

01:18:32.820 --> 01:18:34.410
- Bird on a ladder.
- Sorry.

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:42.190
- Wait here.
- Yeah.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:48.300
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.780
- Have you lost what little mind you have?
- Don't.

01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:10.250
I need to use the chair.

01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:14.450
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:18.230
- The balance.
- Screw the balance.

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:26.800
You dare? In my house?

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:32.980
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:36.120
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:40.050
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:44.620
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:48.420
I need your help!

01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:53.090
Consider it a last request.

01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:59.740
You play a dangerous game.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.880
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.580
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:20.660
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.130
Forgot how big it was.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:30.940
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.940
Yeah.

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.140
Which way's east?

01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:58.630
How many years since you've surfed?

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:01.840
Like riding a bike.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
No, not really.

01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:09.510
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:15.050
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:22.860
Cold.

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:25.120
Little flavor?

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:50.540
- Sure about this?
- No.

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:42.400
Midnite!

01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:51.240
- Any luck?
- That's a word for it.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.980
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:07.130
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.360
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:18.340
Half-breeds are most vulnerable
when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

01:23:18.810 --> 01:23:22.500
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of Isteria,

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.840
have been used by even
the unordained to bless
commonly occurring waters,

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.780
even rain.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.680
Maybe if...

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.780
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.830
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.060
maybe we could take with us?

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:49.760
Look, John, no offense, I just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know...

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.270
you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.140
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's...

01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:00.510
Take him, John. Kill him after.

01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:09.920
If you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:13.030
Okay. I will.

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:20.060
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.200
Praying. Okay.

01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:25.770
Come on.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.320
Half-breeds, right?

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:31.700
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.630
Yeah.

01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:41.140
We can get through them. I mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.980
Right?

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.690
It's not always like it is in the books.

01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:36.830
What is that?

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.330
Hellspeak.

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:44.040
You know what to do.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.940
I'm okay.

01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:52.550
Sure.

01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:06.960
One last show.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.530
Hi.

01:27:43.210 --> 01:27:44.430
My name's John.

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.170
You are in violation of the balance.

01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:53.410
Leave immediately...

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:56.340
or I will deport you.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.150
All of you.

01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:09.460
Go to hell.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.570
Holy water?

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:36.480
Angela.

01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:10.410
John?

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:14.050
John.

01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:21.320
Shit.

01:30:46.690 --> 01:30:48.090
Pull!

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.320
Angela.

01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.980
Angela, what is it?

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.000
Get it out.

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.000
Get it out.

01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:22.610
Get it...

01:33:06.930 --> 01:33:07.920
Oh, my God.

01:33:15.170 --> 01:33:16.760
Not bad, kid.

01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:21.770
"Not bad." You hear that?

01:33:21.940 --> 01:33:26.380
You know why that is? It's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass...

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.160
Chas.

01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:46.760
You're right, John.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.730
It's not like the books.

01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:52.530
No...

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.310
it isn't.

01:34:16.230 --> 01:34:19.030
Into the light, I command thee.

01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:23.530
Into the light, I command thee.

01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:28.800
Into the light, I command thee.

01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:36.980
Into the light, I command thee.

01:34:40.190 --> 01:34:43.060
Your ego is astounding.

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:45.160
Gabriel.

01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:46.520
Figures.

01:34:47.730 --> 01:34:51.170
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:53.730
You judging me now, John?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

01:34:59.170 --> 01:35:03.130
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:07.210
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.250
Help me here.

01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:17.590
You're handed this precious gift, right?

01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:22.850
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:26.390
Murderers, rapists and molesters,

01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:28.900
all of you, you just have to repent

01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:31.900
and God takes you into his bosom.

01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:36.470
In all the worlds in all the universe,

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:39.580
no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

01:35:42.150 --> 01:35:43.380
It's not fair.

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:51.490
If sweet, sweet God loves you so,

01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:54.690
then I'll make you worthy of his love.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.460
I've been watching you for a long time.

01:35:59.630 --> 01:36:04.300
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:08.310
And you can be so noble.

01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:12.600
So...

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.610
I'll bring you pain.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.650
I'll bring you horror.

01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:23.450
So that you may rise above it.

01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:30.830
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.970
will be worthy of God's love.

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.930
Gabriel...

01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:38.640
you're insane.

01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:43.770
The road to salvation begins tonight.

01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:46.280
Right now.

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:30.950
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:35.220
I'm not even welcome in your house.

01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:39.660
But I could use a little attention.

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:44.670
Please.

01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:33.420
Come forth.

01:38:53.170 --> 01:38:55.070
Hurry.

01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:14.160
Mammon,

01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:16.800
son of Satan,

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:21.420
I unleash you unto this world.

01:40:15.190 --> 01:40:16.520
Lu.

01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:18.780
What took you so long?

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.220
Hello, John.

01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:25.260
John, hello.

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:33.070
You're the one soul

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:37.070
I would come up here
to collect myself.

01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:42.810
So I've heard.

01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:44.880
You mind?

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.320
Oh, go... Go right ahead. I've got stock.

01:40:49.290 --> 01:40:50.720
Coffin nail.

01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:53.090
Very fitting, John.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.520
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:02.500
finger movement goes
out the window.

01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:04.730
Let me help you.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:17.710
See?

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:20.950
Sonny...

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.250
I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:28.550
Well, aren't you a peach.

01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:34.200
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

01:41:39.010 --> 01:41:40.970
And you didn't,

01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:43.470
did you?

01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.410
So how's the family?

01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:51.520
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:55.380
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:58.580
Well, one does what one can.

01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.390
He's in the other room.

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:03.330
Boys will be boys.

01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:05.900
With Gabriel.

01:42:08.740 --> 01:42:11.500
No accounting for taste, really.

01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:14.310
They have the Spear of Destiny.

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:20.780
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:32.290
Or is it another one of your cons?

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.660
Go look for yourself.

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:43.330
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:46.760
what's another 20 seconds?

01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:56.700
- Lucifer.
- This world is mine. In time.

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:59.440
You, best of all of us, Gabriel,

01:43:59.610 --> 01:44:04.850
should understand ambition.

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:07.510
Son of perdition.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:09.720
Little horn.

01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:14.060
Most unclean.

01:44:14.230 --> 01:44:16.860
I do miss the old names.

01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:19.930
Time to go home, son.

01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:22.570
I will smite thee...

01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:25.640
in his honor.

01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:35.910
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:54.900
Father?

01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.360
So.

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:28.700
So.

01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:32.830
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

01:45:37.610 --> 01:45:39.600
The sister...

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.840
Isabel.

01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:45.680
What about her?

01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:50.120
Let her go home.

01:45:52.830 --> 01:45:57.390
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:10.230
Fine. It's done.

01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.340
Time to go, John.

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.310
Yeah.

01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:18.130
The sacrifice.

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:35.750
No. This one belongs to me.

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:51.580
No. You will live, John Constantine.

01:47:54.650 --> 01:47:56.080
You will live.

01:47:58.650 --> 01:48:01.120
So you will have...

01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:05.450
the chance to prove...

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:13.470
that your soul truly belongs in hell.

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:19.600
Oh, you will live.

01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:27.850
You will live.

01:49:41.590 --> 01:49:43.580
Thank you.

01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:47.960
No problem.

01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:05.770
Human.

01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:10.240
You don't deserve to be human.

01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:16.450
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

01:50:18.930 --> 01:50:20.480
Do it.

01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:23.320
Do it.

01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:27.030
Seek revenge.

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:29.500
End my life.

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:31.760
Go on.

01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:35.400
Be the hand of God.

01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:37.940
It's your choice.

01:50:38.110 --> 01:50:40.340
It's always been your choice.

01:50:45.650 --> 01:50:47.090
Yeah.

01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:55.130
That's called pain.

01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:56.660
Get used to it.

01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:05.260
You could've shot me, John!

01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:10.280
You chose a higher path!

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:14.480
Look how well you're doing!

01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:42.030
Nice spot.

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:47.800
I have something for you.

01:51:50.850 --> 01:51:53.580
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

01:51:56.620 --> 01:51:59.180
Oh, how thoughtful.

01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:06.300
John...

01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:10.070
why are you giving me this?

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.700
Rules.

01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:13.500
Hide it.

01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:16.700
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:19.410
Not even me.

01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:25.380
Always a catch.

01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:28.410
Yeah.

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:43.370
So.

01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:48.030
I've got some cleaning up to do.

01:52:51.850 --> 01:52:53.840
I'll...

01:52:54.010 --> 01:52:56.310
see you around.

01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:00.750
I'd like that.

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:33.620
<i>I guess there's a plan for all of us.</i>

01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:35.450
<i>I had to die...</i>

01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:36.850
<i>twice...</i>

01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:39.220
<i>just to figure that out.</i>

01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:44.420
<i>Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.</i>

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.760
<i>Some people like it...</i>

01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:49.460
<i>some people don't.</i>

01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:44.980
You did good, kid.
