<i>Attention all workers.</i>

00:05:19.838 --> 00:05:21.737
<i>Attention all workers.</i>

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:24.974
<i>Day shift starting</i>

<i>The safety and well-being</i>

00:05:43.862 --> 00:05:45.762
<i>Attention all workers...</i>

00:05:45.764 --> 00:05:49.132
<i>Did you hear about</i>
<i>the claustrophobic astronaut?</i>

00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:50.266
<i>He needed space.</i>

00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:52.168
I'm begging you,
you got to stop.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.172
I just spent my full share
on a belt that won't fit.

00:05:56.174 --> 00:05:57.739
Huge waist.

00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.810
See that cornbread.

00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:04.180
Maybe it's 'cause
I'm on this seafood diet.

00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:06.084
I see food, I eat it.

00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:09.052
That's so bad.

00:06:09.054 --> 00:06:10.719
You always laughed
at that one.

00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:12.124
Yeah, when I was 12.

00:06:16.862 --> 00:06:18.396
I'm sure it's Mr. Finch.

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:21.099
We owe him three months today.

00:06:22.334 --> 00:06:23.869
He'll call again.

00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:29.172
Well, maybe we won't be here
when he does.

00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:38.083
Andy.
Stay close to me.

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:44.154
<i>Wake up. Wake up now.</i>

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:46.789
<i>We're all</i>
<i>Weyland-Yutani slaves.</i>

00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.192
<i>The company pays us</i>
<i>with food and shelter</i>

00:06:49.194 --> 00:06:52.328
<i>and takes our lives</i>
<i>in exchange.</i>

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.432
<i>Don't believe their lies.</i>

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.333
<i>They own you!</i>

00:06:57.335 --> 00:06:59.102
Andy, Andy.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:00.405
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.

00:07:02.274 --> 00:07:04.407
-What did I do?
-It's a scam.

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.209
The ball is never under
the cup that you pick.

00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:07.343
It's a trick.

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:10.013
But how am I
gonna get the money?

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:10.980
Money for what?

00:07:10.982 --> 00:07:15.118
To pay for the horse
when we get to Yvaga.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.053
You're gonna get a horse?

00:07:17.055 --> 00:07:19.690
I wanna call it Raindy.

00:07:20.825 --> 00:07:22.327
Do you get it?

00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:24.861
-Raindy.
-No, I like it.

00:07:24.863 --> 00:07:26.431
Yeah, it's good.

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:30.867
Okay, so you just
wait over there.

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:32.070
Okay, I might be a minute.

00:07:33.737 --> 00:07:35.271
Stay out of trouble,
all right?

00:07:35.273 --> 00:07:38.241
<i>All employees will be seen.</i>

00:07:38.243 --> 00:07:39.409
Good luck.

00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.011
<i>Line up in an orderly fashion.</i>

00:07:42.013 --> 00:07:43.379
<i>Next.</i>

00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:45.348
<i>Full name</i>
<i>and occupation, please.</i>

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.885
<i>Marie Raines Carradine, ma'am.</i>
<i>Farming.</i>

00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:51.120
It's about my travel papers.

00:07:51.122 --> 00:07:53.825
<i>I met my quota, and I should</i>
<i>be free to go now.</i>

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.291
Right?

00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:56.793
Go where?

00:07:56.795 --> 00:07:58.428
<i>Yvaga.</i>

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.765
<i>It's an independent system,</i>
<i>but it's fully terraformed.</i>

00:08:02.767 --> 00:08:04.834
<i>You can actually see</i>
<i>the sun out there.</i>

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:06.171
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

00:08:07.272 --> 00:08:10.807
<i>Uh, they died</i>
<i>three cycles ago.</i>

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:13.343
Lung disease, from the mines.

00:08:13.345 --> 00:08:16.112
<i>It's just me</i>
<i>and my brother now.</i>

00:08:16.114 --> 00:08:17.313
<i>They sell us hope</i>

00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:19.315
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

00:08:19.317 --> 00:08:25.090
<i>They sell us hope to keep</i>
<i>us slaves. Wake up now.</i>

00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:38.034
I'm sorry,
but you're not eligible

00:08:38.036 --> 00:08:39.335
for contract release yet.

00:08:39.337 --> 00:08:40.436
Due to a shortage of workers,

00:08:40.438 --> 00:08:42.071
you're being
transferred to the mines.

00:08:42.073 --> 00:08:44.007
<i>Wait, what?</i>

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:46.175
<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>I reached the required hours.</i>

00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:47.343
You have to let me go.

00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:50.513
Unfortunately, quotas have
been raised to 24,000 hours,

00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:52.181
so you'll be released
from contract

00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:53.349
in another five to six years.

00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:55.585
Thank you, and remember
the company is really grateful

00:08:55.587 --> 00:08:57.220
for your ongoing service.

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:59.455
-Rain!
-Hey!

00:08:59.457 --> 00:09:00.857
Hey, stop!

00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:02.927
Get off him! You bastards!

00:09:04.596 --> 00:09:06.529
I got you, I got you.

00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:07.966
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

00:09:10.568 --> 00:09:11.836
Okay.

00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:15.405
You're okay.

00:09:15.407 --> 00:09:17.140
I'm resetting you.

00:09:17.142 --> 00:09:18.176
I got you.

00:09:20.845 --> 00:09:22.111
It's okay.

00:09:22.113 --> 00:09:23.481
I shouldn't
have left you alone.

00:09:29.087 --> 00:09:30.486
<i>They sell us hope</i>

00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:32.622
<i>to keep us slaves.</i>

00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:34.893
<i>Wake up now. They own you.</i>

00:09:38.096 --> 00:09:39.295
<i>Hi, Rain.</i>

00:09:39.297 --> 00:09:40.963
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I know</i>
<i>I've been calling you all day,</i>

00:09:40.965 --> 00:09:42.498
<i>but, look,</i>
<i>something's come up,</i>

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.167
<i>and I think you should</i>
<i>know about it.</i>

00:09:44.169 --> 00:09:46.838
<i>So, come by the trailers</i>
<i>and bring Andy.</i>

00:10:17.068 --> 00:10:18.103
Hey.

00:10:19.137 --> 00:10:20.303
Oh, for...

00:10:20.305 --> 00:10:22.271
<i>Game over, man.</i>

00:10:22.273 --> 00:10:25.208
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:26.911
I told you she'd show up.

00:10:27.479 --> 00:10:28.880
You owe me five bucks.

00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:31.149
<i>Andy!</i>

00:10:34.052 --> 00:10:36.219
Why'd the blind miner
fall down the well?

00:10:36.221 --> 00:10:37.522
Why?

00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:40.525
'Cause he couldn't see
that well.

00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:43.926
Please don't encourage him.

00:10:43.928 --> 00:10:45.897
All right, go inside.
I'll be there in a second.

00:10:51.703 --> 00:10:53.269
-Kay.
-Rain.

00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:54.437
-Hi.
-Hi!

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:55.540
Hi.

00:10:56.441 --> 00:10:58.408
I missed you.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:00.311
And I know my brother
missed you, too.

00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:06.985
I'm really glad you came.

00:11:08.319 --> 00:11:10.486
I heard about your dad.

00:11:10.488 --> 00:11:11.523
I'm really sorry.

00:11:12.323 --> 00:11:14.357
Well, between the hailstorms

00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:15.658
and the new diseases
every cycle...

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.460
Yeah, everybody's dying,
right?

00:11:17.462 --> 00:11:19.197
So, should we show her?

00:11:19.564 --> 00:11:21.297
Show me what?

00:11:21.299 --> 00:11:24.333
Okay, so, last night,

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:26.002
we're loading up
the last Tesotek,

00:11:26.004 --> 00:11:27.470
we're about 200 miles
above the ground,

00:11:27.472 --> 00:11:28.604
and then all of a sudden...

00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:32.008
The hauler picks up
this beacon.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.143
So Navarro tracks it,
and it turns out

00:11:34.145 --> 00:11:35.445
there's this big Wey-Yu ship

00:11:35.447 --> 00:11:37.113
drifting
right above our heads.

00:11:37.115 --> 00:11:38.247
Drifting?

00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:40.082
Decommissioned. Abandoned.

00:11:40.084 --> 00:11:42.185
Some old relic. It's probably
damaged or obsolete.

00:11:42.187 --> 00:11:43.486
Like that guy over there.

00:11:43.488 --> 00:11:44.522
Bjorn.

00:11:45.758 --> 00:11:48.257
Okay, just tell her.

00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:50.059
Why are we all
sitting around here

00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:51.594
waiting for travel permits
that the company

00:11:51.596 --> 00:11:53.696
are never gonna give to us?

00:11:53.698 --> 00:11:54.997
'Cause that hauler
has enough power in it

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:55.998
to get us to Yvaga.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.101
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga

00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:01.304
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

00:12:01.306 --> 00:12:02.638
Decommissioned ships
still carry

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.106
tons of functional equipment.

00:12:04.108 --> 00:12:05.541
And the hyperlink shows

00:12:05.543 --> 00:12:07.412
that ship
still has a few pods left.

00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:14.617
You want to break into
a Weyland-Yutani ship

00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:17.220
and steal highly
regulated equipment?

00:12:17.222 --> 00:12:18.521
Before someone else does.

00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:21.624
You guys are insane.

00:12:21.626 --> 00:12:23.059
-Well, of course we are.
-No. No, we're not.

00:12:23.061 --> 00:12:24.360
-This is...
-That's what I said.

00:12:24.362 --> 00:12:25.563
Are you gonna help us?

00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:29.734
Sorry,
what do you need me for?

00:12:32.036 --> 00:12:33.369
Andy.

00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:35.238
-We need to use Andy.
-Andy?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.439
Mm-hmm.

00:12:36.441 --> 00:12:39.175
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic. He speaks Mother.

00:12:39.177 --> 00:12:40.576
He can access
a terminal on the ship

00:12:40.578 --> 00:12:42.278
to get us in and out
without a fuss.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.613
It's the only way to get in.

00:12:43.615 --> 00:12:45.816
Okay,
but what if we get caught?

00:12:45.818 --> 00:12:48.518
It'll ruin our chances of ever
getting a travel permit.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.286
Right, Rain's not comin'.

00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:53.322
Uh, how about you let us
take Andy then?

00:12:53.324 --> 00:12:56.425
I'm not sending
my brother up there alone.

00:12:56.427 --> 00:12:57.593
He's not your
brother though, is he?

00:12:57.595 --> 00:12:59.830
-Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
-It's true, though, isn't it?

00:12:59.832 --> 00:13:01.364
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods

00:13:01.366 --> 00:13:03.065
that your dad
found in the trash.

00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:05.004
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

00:13:05.537 --> 00:13:06.636
Let's go.

00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:07.603
-Rain?
-What?

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:10.706
-I didn't say anything.
-Rain, wait.

00:13:10.708 --> 00:13:11.808
I'm sorry.
Listen, I know my cousin

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.142
can be a dick sometimes,
all right?

00:13:13.144 --> 00:13:14.712
But he is right
about something.

00:13:15.446 --> 00:13:16.780
You need to wake up.

00:13:16.782 --> 00:13:17.848
Because this company,

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:18.949
they're not gonna
give us anything.

00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:21.317
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

00:13:25.356 --> 00:13:27.223
Rain, I just...

00:13:27.225 --> 00:13:29.060
I don't want to end up
like our parents.

00:13:29.627 --> 00:13:30.829
Do you?

00:13:35.834 --> 00:13:40.436
Is it as easy as you're making
it sound, this plan of yours?

00:13:40.438 --> 00:13:42.705
You won't even have to get out
of the <i>Corbelan.</i>

00:13:42.707 --> 00:13:44.509
That much
I can promise you, okay?

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.181
Come on. What do you say?

00:14:14.439 --> 00:14:16.107
Bjorn, hurry up,
let's go.

00:14:20.211 --> 00:14:23.147
All right, I'm starting
her up. Batteries on.

00:14:25.516 --> 00:14:26.351
Lovely.

00:14:28.353 --> 00:14:29.621
Could I get hydro,
please?

00:14:30.722 --> 00:14:31.757
Comm panel.

00:14:33.725 --> 00:14:34.891
Ground spoilers.

00:14:34.893 --> 00:14:36.194
They are armed.

00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:38.361
First time
in space, huh?

00:14:38.363 --> 00:14:39.397
Yeah.

00:14:40.598 --> 00:14:42.933
You too? Boop!

00:14:42.935 --> 00:14:45.201
-Fuel pump.
-On.

00:14:45.203 --> 00:14:46.268
Two space virgins
coming through.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.738
Right, take a good look
outside the window

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.843
'cause the way I see it,
we're never coming back.

00:15:04.322 --> 00:15:05.488
You good?

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.524
I'm good.

00:15:07.492 --> 00:15:08.526
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:29.478
Are you sure
this is a good idea now?

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.581
Sure, Dad.

00:15:36.254 --> 00:15:37.355
Here comes the crush.

00:15:56.474 --> 00:15:57.810
That's how it's done,
bitch.

00:16:54.298 --> 00:16:55.333
Is that...

00:16:56.734 --> 00:16:58.068
Yeah.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.838
That is our sun.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.818
They say Yvaga has
the most incredible sunsets.

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:16.387
I've seen them.

00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:21.357
In my dreams.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.394
I can't wait
to see them with you.

00:17:26.731 --> 00:17:27.766
Yeah.

00:17:30.803 --> 00:17:32.803
You know, I heard that
cryo-sleep just makes years

00:17:32.805 --> 00:17:34.570
feel like one night
of heavy drinkin' apparently.

00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:36.641
So when we wake up
in Yvaga tomorrow,

00:17:37.675 --> 00:17:39.310
we'll wake up with a hangover.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:49.654
There she is.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.424
That's not a ship.

00:17:53.691 --> 00:17:55.859
No.

00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:57.794
<i>Fuck,</i>
<i>that's big. What is that?</i>

00:17:57.796 --> 00:17:59.930
<i>Decommissioned outpost?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:17:59.932 --> 00:18:01.597
<i>Probably got dragged</i>
<i>into our orbit.</i>

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:03.666
Okay, Navarro,
let's get closer, please.

00:18:03.668 --> 00:18:05.736
Okay.
I'm gonna match its roll.

00:18:22.087 --> 00:18:24.823
<i>Hazard proximity alert.</i>

00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:27.157
What's wrong?

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:29.694
It's just the belt's a bit
closer than I thought.

00:18:31.596 --> 00:18:32.630
How long?

00:18:34.032 --> 00:18:35.799
It's 36 hours, give or take.

00:18:35.801 --> 00:18:36.800
Till what?

00:18:36.802 --> 00:18:39.870
Before the station crashes
against the rings.

00:18:39.872 --> 00:18:41.938
Sorry, what?

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.406
What did you just say?
That doesn't sound very good.

00:18:44.408 --> 00:18:45.641
36 hours.

00:18:45.643 --> 00:18:47.145
We should be in and out
in 30 minutes.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.645
Yeah?

00:18:49.647 --> 00:18:50.780
Andy.

00:18:50.782 --> 00:18:52.481
Yeah, tops.

00:18:52.483 --> 00:18:54.719
Are you sure
you wanna do this?

00:18:55.787 --> 00:18:58.587
I have just one directive.

00:18:58.589 --> 00:19:00.458
To do what's best for Rain.

00:19:01.592 --> 00:19:03.394
Your dad wrote it.

00:19:03.896 --> 00:19:04.930
Yeah.

00:19:05.964 --> 00:19:07.831
That and too many dad jokes.

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:09.167
I'm happy...

00:19:10.068 --> 00:19:11.435
to help.

00:19:16.474 --> 00:19:17.910
Be careful out there.

00:19:33.992 --> 00:19:35.827
Okay, hurry up.
We're docking in two minutes.

00:19:38.163 --> 00:19:39.528
Put that on.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.064
Now,
why I gotta put this on for?

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:42.631
So you don't
freeze your balls off.

00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:43.767
Mate,
you gotta stop obsessing

00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:45.201
about my balls, man.
It's unhealthy.

00:19:45.203 --> 00:19:46.435
Keep talking
and I'll chop 'em off.

00:19:46.437 --> 00:19:48.737
Aw, you really want
'em for yourself, don't you?

00:19:48.739 --> 00:19:50.040
Hey, you want me to show you
my balls or something?

00:19:50.042 --> 00:19:51.473
Oh, shut up a minute.

00:19:51.475 --> 00:19:53.243
Gloves, here, take these.

00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:55.812
Hey! No.
Stop touching shit.

00:19:55.814 --> 00:19:57.047
-Come over here.
-Bjorn, leave him alone,

00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:59.082
for fuck's sake.

00:19:59.084 --> 00:20:00.482
Andy, take no notice.

00:20:00.484 --> 00:20:01.550
All right, okay,
won't be my fault

00:20:01.552 --> 00:20:02.620
when he breaks somethin'.

00:20:10.494 --> 00:20:11.593
There's a synth hatch

00:20:11.595 --> 00:20:12.862
right ahead. I'm gonna dock.

00:20:12.864 --> 00:20:14.199
<i>Copy that.</i>
<i>Just bring us in slow.</i>

00:20:41.193 --> 00:20:42.794
Oh, fuck me,
it's cold in there.

00:20:43.561 --> 00:20:44.828
What's that?

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.030
<i>It's a temp-scanner.</i>

00:20:47.032 --> 00:20:48.699
<i>It's gonna lead us</i>
<i>to the pods.</i>

00:20:51.003 --> 00:20:53.036
Okay, compression
is good enough.

00:20:53.038 --> 00:20:55.138
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.572
Andy...

00:20:56.574 --> 00:20:57.974
<i>...you're up.</i>

00:20:57.976 --> 00:20:59.277
<i>It's your time to shine.</i>

00:21:05.283 --> 00:21:07.150
<i>Yes! Andy!</i>

00:21:07.152 --> 00:21:08.253
<i>Beautiful work.</i>

00:21:08.754 --> 00:21:09.821
<i>Okay.</i>

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.291
<i>Congrats.</i>
<i>You're not a virgin anymore.</i>

00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:15.659
<i>All right.</i>

00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:27.605
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

00:21:59.838 --> 00:22:01.037
<i>Fuck.</i>

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:03.173
<i>Guys, it looks like</i>
<i>we're in zero-g.</i>

00:22:03.175 --> 00:22:04.910
<i>Yeah, I can feel it</i>
<i>in my stomach.</i>

00:22:10.282 --> 00:22:11.613
Wait, what's that?

00:22:11.615 --> 00:22:12.882
Gravity generators.

00:22:12.884 --> 00:22:15.852
When offline, they still purge
themselves every few minutes.

00:22:15.854 --> 00:22:17.789
<i>Prevents the place</i>
<i>from blowing up.</i>

00:22:21.526 --> 00:22:23.895
<i>Oh, fuck me,</i>
<i>there goes my stomach again.</i>

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.131
<i>Okay, straight ahead.</i>

00:23:03.368 --> 00:23:04.801
<i>According</i>
<i>to the scanner,</i>

00:23:04.803 --> 00:23:06.004
<i>the pods should be in here.</i>

00:23:34.766 --> 00:23:36.099
<i>Jesus.</i>

00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:37.333
<i>Andy, you good?</i>

00:23:37.335 --> 00:23:38.436
Yeah.

00:23:44.876 --> 00:23:47.445
<i>All right, great news.</i>
<i>I've got eyes on the pods.</i>

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:53.185
<i>Fuck!</i>

00:23:56.388 --> 00:23:57.455
<i>Bjorn, you okay?</i>

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.190
<i>Fuck!</i>

00:24:00.192 --> 00:24:02.125
<i>I think I fractured</i>
<i>my asshole.</i>

00:24:06.932 --> 00:24:09.367
<i>Fuckin' hell. Don't fuck</i>
<i>with this gravity purge, man.</i>

00:24:25.183 --> 00:24:26.282
<i>Thank God,</i>
<i>there's still</i>

00:24:26.284 --> 00:24:27.485
<i>some power left in this relic.</i>

00:24:43.802 --> 00:24:46.336
<i>Okay, watch out.</i>
<i>Gravity's coming back.</i>

00:24:46.338 --> 00:24:48.840
<i>Fuckin' hell.</i>

00:24:55.413 --> 00:24:57.347
All right, here we go.

00:24:57.349 --> 00:24:58.516
Let's see what we got.

00:24:59.884 --> 00:25:00.986
Okay.

00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:08.358
-Shit.
-What's the problem?

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.959
Pods don't have enough fuel.

00:25:09.961 --> 00:25:11.261
What do you mean?

00:25:11.263 --> 00:25:13.062
<i>They're loaded up</i>
<i>for three years in stasis.</i>

00:25:13.064 --> 00:25:14.130
Yeah,
but it takes nine years

00:25:14.132 --> 00:25:15.431
to get to Yvaga, mate.

00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:17.133
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm aware of that.

00:25:17.135 --> 00:25:18.534
Fuckin' hell.

00:25:18.536 --> 00:25:20.069
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

00:25:20.071 --> 00:25:21.204
-I knew it.
-Just relax.

00:25:21.206 --> 00:25:22.305
Maybe you guys
should just come back.

00:25:22.307 --> 00:25:23.141
<i>No, no,</i>
<i>we're not givin' up now.</i>

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.843
Yvaga's
the nearest system.

00:25:26.845 --> 00:25:29.979
So what are we supposed
to do now? Huh?

00:25:29.981 --> 00:25:32.115
-What are we gonna do?
-Shut up.

00:25:32.117 --> 00:25:35.084
Okay, strong reading.
Must be a cryo depot nearby.

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:37.020
We should find
more fuel there.

00:25:37.022 --> 00:25:40.256
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

00:25:40.258 --> 00:25:41.324
Come on, Andy.

00:25:41.326 --> 00:25:43.261
You guys pick it up
while we get the cryo-fuel.

00:26:03.481 --> 00:26:04.516
Hold.

00:26:05.884 --> 00:26:07.585
Yeah, 400 yards away,
dead ahead.

00:26:09.254 --> 00:26:10.386
What's with the military shit?

00:26:10.388 --> 00:26:11.487
What?

00:26:11.489 --> 00:26:12.422
All that military shit.

00:26:12.424 --> 00:26:15.325
-Well, it's effective.
-Is it?

00:26:15.327 --> 00:26:16.459
-And cool.
-It's not very cool.

00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:18.461
You just look like a twat.

00:26:18.463 --> 00:26:19.962
-I'm sorry.
-All right, chill.

00:26:19.964 --> 00:26:21.230
<i>Let's keep it movin'.</i>

00:26:21.232 --> 00:26:22.298
<i>If you do that again,</i>
<i>I'll fuck you up.</i>

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.366
-Bjorn, back off!
<i>-You understand?</i>

00:26:23.368 --> 00:26:25.435
<i>Just as long as he stays</i>
<i>out of my way.</i>

00:26:25.437 --> 00:26:28.071
Why is he being
such a dick to him?

00:26:28.073 --> 00:26:30.907
Because of what happened
to his mom.

00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:32.442
-What do you mean?
-Last cycle,

00:26:32.444 --> 00:26:34.177
there was a gas leak
in the mines,

00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:36.312
so a synthetic made the call
to seal them

00:26:36.314 --> 00:26:38.214
with Bjorn's mom
still trapped inside.

00:26:38.216 --> 00:26:39.482
What?

00:26:39.484 --> 00:26:41.217
Synthetics can't harm humans.

00:26:41.219 --> 00:26:44.255
It sacrificed three miners
to save a dozen.

00:26:46.391 --> 00:26:47.559
That, they can do.

00:26:53.164 --> 00:26:54.299
That's terrible.

00:27:39.077 --> 00:27:41.312
I got you, I got you.

00:27:43.047 --> 00:27:44.949
Come on, come on, come on.

00:27:46.484 --> 00:27:48.186
Easy, easy.

00:27:53.091 --> 00:27:54.426
Good job.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.265
Kay!

00:28:01.266 --> 00:28:02.732
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.

00:28:02.734 --> 00:28:04.634
Hey, hey, hey.

00:28:04.636 --> 00:28:06.402
I'm right here.
I'm right here. You're okay.

00:28:07.372 --> 00:28:08.671
I'm gonna go
check on the pods.

00:28:26.524 --> 00:28:28.426
No, no. Don't worry.

00:28:29.327 --> 00:28:31.093
I'm not sick.

00:28:31.095 --> 00:28:32.130
What's wrong, then?

00:28:33.766 --> 00:28:35.166
Nothing is.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.071
Oh, girl.

00:28:43.074 --> 00:28:44.142
Who's the father?

00:28:45.343 --> 00:28:46.578
Some asshole.

00:28:48.513 --> 00:28:51.716
Just don't tell my brother,
okay?

00:28:53.117 --> 00:28:54.550
He has enough things
to worry about.

00:28:54.552 --> 00:28:57.019
No. I won't say anything.

00:28:57.021 --> 00:28:59.724
I'm just happy this baby
will get to see the sun.

00:29:22.514 --> 00:29:24.115
I think
we're almost there.

00:29:28.486 --> 00:29:30.152
Okay, Navarro.

00:29:30.154 --> 00:29:31.554
<i>Airlock 5-B,</i>
<i>that's our way out</i>

00:29:31.556 --> 00:29:32.688
<i>once we find this cryo-fuel.</i>

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:33.656
On my way.

00:29:33.658 --> 00:29:35.258
<i>Welcome to the</i>

<i>mankind's role in outer space.</i>

00:29:55.246 --> 00:29:58.347
This place
gives me the creeps.

00:29:58.349 --> 00:30:01.319
Did you hear about the miner
who lost his left side?

00:30:02.788 --> 00:30:04.120
He's all right now.

00:30:04.122 --> 00:30:05.588
Do you get it? He's all right.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.392
Can you turn
yourself off, please?

00:30:08.493 --> 00:30:10.126
You said you were nervous

00:30:10.128 --> 00:30:11.127
and I was trying
to make sure you were...

00:30:11.129 --> 00:30:14.430
Jesus! You know, I can't
wait to get in them pods

00:30:14.432 --> 00:30:16.267
and never see you again,
you know that?

00:30:18.336 --> 00:30:20.236
<i>You'll see me in Yvaga.</i>

00:30:20.238 --> 00:30:21.637
<i>No,</i>
<i>you're not going to Yvaga.</i>

00:30:21.639 --> 00:30:22.775
<i>Bjorn, stop!</i>

00:30:23.408 --> 00:30:24.607
<i>I'm not?</i>

00:30:24.609 --> 00:30:25.741
Well done.

00:30:25.743 --> 00:30:27.811
Oh, she didn't tell you?

00:30:27.813 --> 00:30:30.682
Yeah, yeah, it's a
non-Weyland-Yutani system,

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.118
so no fake people allowed.

00:30:35.587 --> 00:30:38.122
I prefer the term
"artificial person" myself.

00:30:40.525 --> 00:30:42.491
Andy, look.

00:30:42.493 --> 00:30:43.794
<i>Rain could end up in prison</i>

00:30:43.796 --> 00:30:44.761
<i>if she takes you with her.</i>

00:30:44.763 --> 00:30:46.329
<i>And if you guys</i>
<i>stay in Jackson,</i>

00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:47.663
<i>it's just a matter of time</i>

00:30:47.665 --> 00:30:49.768
<i>before you get decommissioned</i>
<i>again by the company.</i>

00:30:50.468 --> 00:30:52.501
<i>You understand?</i>

00:30:52.503 --> 00:30:54.472
<i>I need you on the ship</i>
<i>to guard the pods.</i>

00:30:55.306 --> 00:30:56.507
But once we get there...

00:30:57.776 --> 00:30:59.275
Decommish.

00:30:59.277 --> 00:31:00.409
Lights out for good.

00:31:01.847 --> 00:31:03.346
You done?

00:31:03.348 --> 00:31:04.515
<i>Just tellin' the truth.</i>

00:31:08.252 --> 00:31:10.586
<i>That's okay.</i>

00:31:10.588 --> 00:31:13.826
<i>If it's what's best for Rain,</i>
<i>it's what's best for me.</i>

00:31:17.695 --> 00:31:19.530
You're a good guy, Andy.

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.200
We're all gonna miss you.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.874
So he didn't know?

00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:33.344
I just did not
have the heart to tell him.

00:31:35.246 --> 00:31:36.514
You shouldn't feel bad.

00:31:38.917 --> 00:31:40.282
Shit.

00:31:40.284 --> 00:31:41.384
You're not gonna throw

00:31:41.386 --> 00:31:43.287
your whole life away
for Andy's sake.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:47.926
He doesn't care.
It doesn't matter to him.

00:31:49.694 --> 00:31:51.295
Okay? He's not...

00:31:52.397 --> 00:31:53.932
you know, real.

00:32:17.756 --> 00:32:19.624
The signal's
coming from in here.

00:32:29.467 --> 00:32:31.802
Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:33.837
Yeah.

00:32:33.839 --> 00:32:35.839
<i>Doesn't look</i>
<i>decommissioned to me.</i>

00:32:35.841 --> 00:32:37.306
No, it doesn't.

00:32:37.308 --> 00:32:39.542
But it's definitely deserted.

00:32:39.544 --> 00:32:42.478
Hey, Andy, look at this.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.582
I could probably fry a
synthetic with one of these...

00:32:45.383 --> 00:32:46.950
if I just amp up the juices.

00:32:50.488 --> 00:32:51.922
Hey, you know, I might
take this with me, actually.

00:32:51.924 --> 00:32:52.923
All right, enough.

00:32:52.925 --> 00:32:55.226
Just in case you have
any fucking funny ideas.

00:32:56.327 --> 00:32:59.428
It's a joke.
I was joking.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.465
What the fuck?

00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:01.867
Watch out.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.611
<i>Shit.</i>

00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:19.682
It's only a synthetic.

00:33:21.652 --> 00:33:23.619
Fuck.

00:33:23.621 --> 00:33:25.756
I thought it was a real person
there for a second.

00:33:25.758 --> 00:33:27.423
<i>What happened in there?</i>

00:33:27.425 --> 00:33:29.293
Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

00:33:30.394 --> 00:33:31.393
The fuel must be in that room.

00:33:31.395 --> 00:33:33.031
Let's grab it
and get the fuck out of here.

00:33:38.636 --> 00:33:40.438
All right. Andy?

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:56.054
Bjorn,
take the torch please.

00:34:01.392 --> 00:34:03.392
I don't think
there's any pods in here.

00:34:03.394 --> 00:34:04.761
Nah,
just cooling equipment.

00:34:04.763 --> 00:34:06.531
Uses the same type of fuel,
though.

00:34:12.771 --> 00:34:13.806
Yes.

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.007
<i>Forty-five Ks.</i>

00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:20.010
<i>It's more than enough fuel</i>
<i>to get us to Yvaga.</i>

00:34:20.012 --> 00:34:22.446
Right. Bjorn, give me
a hand with this, please.

00:34:31.857 --> 00:34:33.790
Bjorn, pull it out
on three, all right?

00:34:33.792 --> 00:34:34.991
-Ready?
-Uh-huh.

00:34:34.993 --> 00:34:36.394
One, two...

00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:38.627
three.

00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:39.896
Fuck!

00:34:39.898 --> 00:34:41.099
-Fuck.
-My fingers.

00:34:42.935 --> 00:34:43.969
I can't feel my fingers.

00:34:51.977 --> 00:34:53.777
<i>It really hurts.</i>
<i>Just froze my hands off.</i>

00:34:53.779 --> 00:34:55.544
-What's happening?
<i>-Fuck.</i>

00:34:55.546 --> 00:34:57.848
Don't know. It's some
kind of emergency lockdown.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.417
Andy, the door.

00:35:02.921 --> 00:35:04.420
Shit, he doesn't
have the clearance.

00:35:04.422 --> 00:35:05.521
What does that mean?

00:35:05.523 --> 00:35:06.859
Doesn't have the
clearance to open the door.

00:35:07.759 --> 00:35:09.025
So you're trying
to tell me that

00:35:09.027 --> 00:35:10.492
he can fucking reboot
the entire ship,

00:35:10.494 --> 00:35:11.560
but can't open
a random fucking door

00:35:11.562 --> 00:35:12.796
to a random room?

00:35:12.798 --> 00:35:14.766
Well, obviously,
that's no random room.

00:35:18.136 --> 00:35:19.938
Come on!

00:35:20.471 --> 00:35:21.672
Come on!

00:35:39.124 --> 00:35:40.792
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

00:35:44.662 --> 00:35:46.062
If Andy
can't open those doors,

00:35:46.064 --> 00:35:47.866
I doubt
we'll have better luck.

00:35:49.001 --> 00:35:51.467
He's a Weyland-Yutani
synthetic

00:35:51.469 --> 00:35:52.601
and we're just trespassing.

00:35:53.805 --> 00:35:55.473
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

00:35:56.008 --> 00:35:57.042
Not yet.

00:35:59.845 --> 00:36:01.113
I think it's in here.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:05.884
Bjorn!

00:36:07.718 --> 00:36:08.754
Tyler!

00:36:13.158 --> 00:36:14.425
They're in there.

00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:20.163
Hey, what are you doing?

00:36:20.165 --> 00:36:21.164
If this module
is still working,

00:36:21.166 --> 00:36:24.234
I can try to transfer
its credentials to Andy.

00:36:24.236 --> 00:36:26.204
A higher clearance
should open that door.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.574
Shit. It's stuck.

00:37:06.044 --> 00:37:08.013
It's so hot in here, man.

00:37:32.804 --> 00:37:33.872
Whoa.

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:36.638
Sick.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.108
Yeah, maybe try not to touch
anything in here.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.144
Yeah, okay, Mom.

00:37:43.748 --> 00:37:45.115
Help me! Help!

00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:46.249
Oh, no! What do I do?

00:37:46.251 --> 00:37:47.853
The module. Take it out!

00:37:53.325 --> 00:37:54.658
You okay?

00:37:55.961 --> 00:37:57.260
That was fucked up.

00:37:57.262 --> 00:37:58.895
Here.

00:37:58.897 --> 00:37:59.998
Let me see.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.665
Yes, okay.

00:38:03.667 --> 00:38:04.834
All right.

00:38:04.836 --> 00:38:06.836
-Got it.
-Hey.

00:38:06.838 --> 00:38:07.873
Rain.

00:38:09.074 --> 00:38:10.876
This is from that synthetic.

00:38:12.077 --> 00:38:13.879
Try putting it
on Andy's module.

00:38:18.083 --> 00:38:19.117
I'm so sorry.

00:38:20.152 --> 00:38:21.552
Let's just get outta here.

00:38:23.088 --> 00:38:24.122
Andy?

00:38:26.792 --> 00:38:28.060
All right, let's see.

00:38:31.296 --> 00:38:32.330
Okay.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.634
Fuck.

00:38:38.636 --> 00:38:40.736
Rain, did I do something
wrong? He's just frozen up.

00:38:40.738 --> 00:38:42.105
He's just rebooting.

00:38:42.107 --> 00:38:43.942
It's gonna take
a couple of minutes.

00:39:06.965 --> 00:39:08.699
Here, let me get you
something for those fingers.

00:39:16.674 --> 00:39:17.943
The fuck was that?

00:39:21.113 --> 00:39:22.680
All right,
stay there a second.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:27.786
Tyler?

00:39:32.357 --> 00:39:33.859
Hey,
what are you guys doing?

00:39:42.767 --> 00:39:44.834
Bjorn?

00:39:44.836 --> 00:39:46.169
Stop playing around, man.
Just get up.

00:39:46.171 --> 00:39:47.237
I'm not
playing around.

00:39:47.239 --> 00:39:48.204
There's something
in the water.

00:39:48.206 --> 00:39:49.705
What do you mean?
What is it?

00:39:49.707 --> 00:39:50.607
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:51.943
There's something
in the fuckin' water.

00:39:56.714 --> 00:39:57.748
Bjorn!

00:40:00.252 --> 00:40:02.218
Fuck!

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.255
What the fuck
was that?

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.895
Andy!

00:40:12.097 --> 00:40:13.131
Bjorn!

00:40:19.371 --> 00:40:21.371
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

00:40:21.373 --> 00:40:22.472
Bjorn!

00:40:27.112 --> 00:40:28.780
-Tyler!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:40:31.016 --> 00:40:32.348
Come on!

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:34.417
-Come on! Help me!
-No, stop. Stop. Don't...

00:40:34.419 --> 00:40:36.186
-No! Navarro!
-Those things will get out.

00:40:36.188 --> 00:40:38.121
If they come in here...
If they come in...

00:40:38.123 --> 00:40:39.257
-If they come...
-No!

00:40:43.128 --> 00:40:44.329
Fuck. Fuck.

00:41:10.956 --> 00:41:12.457
Andy! Let's go!

00:41:14.759 --> 00:41:15.892
Go! Bjorn!

00:41:15.894 --> 00:41:16.928
Andy, the door!

00:41:17.929 --> 00:41:19.062
-Bjorn!
-Come on, come on.

00:41:19.064 --> 00:41:20.098
Come on, come on, come on!

00:41:22.534 --> 00:41:23.833
Get out of there!

00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:24.901
Come on, come on,
come on!

00:41:24.903 --> 00:41:26.502
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Go, go, go!

00:41:26.504 --> 00:41:27.939
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

00:41:31.276 --> 00:41:33.543
Go! Go!

00:41:33.545 --> 00:41:35.878
-Bjorn, come on!
-Go! Go!

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:42.454
Andy, the door!

00:41:51.463 --> 00:41:52.528
Stay still.
Stay still.

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.297
I know!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:41:56.201 --> 00:41:57.934
It's choking her.

00:41:57.936 --> 00:41:59.502
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

00:41:59.504 --> 00:42:00.538
-It's choking her!
-Shit.

00:42:01.172 --> 00:42:02.872
Stop! Bjorn!

00:42:02.874 --> 00:42:04.440
Bjorn, stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!

00:42:04.442 --> 00:42:05.875
-Stop!
-What's it doin'?

00:42:05.877 --> 00:42:07.110
Is it fuckin' killin' her?

00:42:07.112 --> 00:42:09.281
I do not believe that's
what the creature is doing.

00:42:09.814 --> 00:42:10.849
No.

00:42:11.216 --> 00:42:12.250
Andy?

00:42:13.918 --> 00:42:15.852
Based on the rhythmic
dilatation of those bladders,

00:42:15.854 --> 00:42:18.221
and its synchronization
to her breathing patterns,

00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:21.391
I'd surmise it's feeding her
oxygen to keep her alive.

00:42:21.393 --> 00:42:23.261
For what purpose,
I do not know.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:26.498
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

00:42:28.867 --> 00:42:31.534
I'm an ND-255
Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

00:42:31.536 --> 00:42:33.938
Originally built for mining
and safety tasks.

00:42:35.006 --> 00:42:36.172
You guys call me Andy.

00:42:36.174 --> 00:42:37.409
It's that module.

00:42:39.244 --> 00:42:40.278
Yes.

00:42:41.946 --> 00:42:44.414
That new module didn't
just upgrade my credentials.

00:42:44.416 --> 00:42:46.149
It substantially
updated my AI,

00:42:46.151 --> 00:42:48.953
and it's mending my motor
systems as we speak.

00:42:50.121 --> 00:42:52.121
A most overdue upgrade,
I must say.

00:42:52.123 --> 00:42:53.222
Shit. I'mma fucking
fry this thing.

00:42:53.224 --> 00:42:54.324
-Okay, wait.
-Don't!

00:42:54.326 --> 00:42:55.958
-Why not?
-That amount of current

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.327
will violently
contract its tail flexors

00:42:57.329 --> 00:42:58.528
and will break her neck.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.029
So what,
you got a better idea?

00:43:00.031 --> 00:43:01.297
What should we
fucking do then, huh?

00:43:01.299 --> 00:43:03.166
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey.

00:43:03.168 --> 00:43:05.003
Andy, do you know
how to help her?

00:43:06.004 --> 00:43:07.136
I'm afraid my
knowledge database

00:43:07.138 --> 00:43:08.604
has not really changed.

00:43:08.606 --> 00:43:10.139
I do not know
what this creature is

00:43:10.141 --> 00:43:11.576
or how to remove it safely.

00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:16.614
But there's someone
in this room who might.

00:43:47.145 --> 00:43:49.479
I need to secure
Z-01 compound.

00:43:49.481 --> 00:43:51.481
Mission's priority. All other
priorities rescinded.

00:43:51.483 --> 00:43:53.483
Must complete the mission.

00:43:53.485 --> 00:43:54.984
I'm sorry...

00:43:54.986 --> 00:43:56.519
but your mission has failed.

00:43:56.521 --> 00:43:58.590
What? No, I...

00:44:04.129 --> 00:44:06.231
Can you tell us
what we can do to help her?

00:44:07.399 --> 00:44:09.667
You don't help her. You run.

00:44:10.535 --> 00:44:12.535
Get out, however you got in.

00:44:12.537 --> 00:44:14.270
No, no, no.
Wait, whoa, whoa.

00:44:14.272 --> 00:44:16.439
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin'
her, okay? You understand?

00:44:16.441 --> 00:44:19.208
Then have mercy
and end her life now.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:22.013
If not, you all die.

00:44:24.082 --> 00:44:25.648
So what the fuck
is he sayin'?

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.183
What's it doing to her?

00:44:27.185 --> 00:44:28.351
The parasitoid is implanting

00:44:28.353 --> 00:44:30.119
the Plagiarus Praepotens
in her.

00:44:30.121 --> 00:44:31.387
I beg your pardon?

00:44:31.389 --> 00:44:34.223
A seed that will amalgamate
with her DNA

00:44:34.225 --> 00:44:35.558
and rapidly grow out of her.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:37.128
What's gonna grow out of her?

00:44:48.673 --> 00:44:51.543
XX121 Xenomorph.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:53.543
One of our towing ships

00:44:53.545 --> 00:44:57.213
first made contact with this
specimen two decades ago.

00:44:57.215 --> 00:44:58.247
Of the seven crew members

00:44:58.249 --> 00:45:00.616
aboard the <i>USS Nostromo,</i>
only one survived,

00:45:00.618 --> 00:45:03.486
blowing the creature
out of the airlock.

00:45:03.488 --> 00:45:06.389
We've been searching
for it ever since.

00:45:06.391 --> 00:45:09.725
170 days ago,
our search came to an end

00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:11.996
and the body of the Xenomorph
was brought on board...

00:45:12.497 --> 00:45:14.230
presumed dead.

00:45:14.232 --> 00:45:15.431
But of course,

00:45:15.433 --> 00:45:19.602
lack of oxygen and food is
of no true consequence to this

00:45:19.604 --> 00:45:21.270
perfect organism.

00:45:21.272 --> 00:45:23.308
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

00:45:25.076 --> 00:45:26.509
Clearly.

00:45:26.511 --> 00:45:30.012
It wreaked havoc
over this station,

00:45:30.014 --> 00:45:32.615
until what was left of our
security forces shot it dead.

00:45:32.617 --> 00:45:35.320
Only to trigger its swan song.

00:45:36.321 --> 00:45:37.453
Acid for blood?

00:45:37.455 --> 00:45:39.355
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

00:45:39.357 --> 00:45:41.224
I sealed the station back up,
but it was too late.

00:45:41.226 --> 00:45:42.492
Hey, shut up!

00:45:42.494 --> 00:45:44.293
Nobody cares about your
fucking ship anymore.

00:45:44.295 --> 00:45:46.162
Okay, okay. Okay.

00:45:46.164 --> 00:45:48.331
What if we use the cryo-fuel

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:51.100
to freeze
the root of the tail?

00:45:51.102 --> 00:45:54.005
Maybe if it's frozen,
it won't choke her.

00:45:55.173 --> 00:45:56.307
That could work.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:26.604
All right, get it off!
Get it off!

00:46:48.359 --> 00:46:50.359
It's gone. It's off
of you. It's off of you.

00:46:51.729 --> 00:46:53.563
It's off. It's off. It's off.

00:46:53.565 --> 00:46:55.331
You're okay. You're okay.

00:46:55.333 --> 00:46:56.634
I wouldn't be so sure.

00:47:02.206 --> 00:47:03.339
What are the odds?

00:47:03.341 --> 00:47:05.741
60 to 40 against your friend.

00:47:05.743 --> 00:47:06.711
What are the odds on what?

00:47:08.746 --> 00:47:10.548
That the creature's
finished its job already.

00:47:12.885 --> 00:47:14.319
What is he
talking about?

00:47:16.187 --> 00:47:17.653
Listen to me.

00:47:17.655 --> 00:47:20.389
Humans go through
too many emotional stages

00:47:20.391 --> 00:47:22.525
before accepting the cold,

00:47:22.527 --> 00:47:24.828
yet rational -sometimes
hardest -path.

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:26.763
You must help them.

00:47:26.765 --> 00:47:27.898
You must help them.

00:47:33.171 --> 00:47:34.205
Andy?

00:47:35.173 --> 00:47:36.305
-What's going on?
-I'm sorry

00:47:36.307 --> 00:47:37.774
but we can't let her back
on the ship.

00:47:37.776 --> 00:47:39.709
-Oh, yeah? That is a problem.
-What're you doing?

00:47:39.711 --> 00:47:40.911
-You must understand.
-You see?

00:47:40.913 --> 00:47:41.912
That's what I mean
by "funny ideas"!

00:47:41.914 --> 00:47:44.313
What're you talking
about? No, he's...

00:47:44.315 --> 00:47:45.816
-No! No!
-You fuckin' bitch!

00:47:45.818 --> 00:47:47.316
Hey! Andy! Andy!

00:47:47.318 --> 00:47:48.451
We're gonna go.

00:47:48.453 --> 00:47:49.685
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm right here.

00:47:49.687 --> 00:47:51.322
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:54.590
Tyler, let's go, man! Come on!

00:47:54.592 --> 00:47:55.458
-I'm here.
-Bjorn! No.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.627
Bjorn, we're not leaving
without them!

00:47:57.629 --> 00:47:58.795
-I'm here.
-Bjorn!

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:02.565
-Where are they?
-You need to listen.

00:48:02.567 --> 00:48:03.666
We have to start the ship,
okay?

00:48:03.668 --> 00:48:04.835
-Just go and start the ship.
-Where's Rain? How...

00:48:04.837 --> 00:48:06.770
Forgive me.

00:48:06.772 --> 00:48:09.338
I've been nothing
but a burden to you.

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.508
Today, I can finally help.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.813
And you won't see me
as a child anymore.

00:48:16.815 --> 00:48:17.850
What?

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:19.749
Andy!

00:48:29.394 --> 00:48:30.428
-Hey!
-Bjorn!

00:48:53.952 --> 00:48:55.186
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:48:55.687 --> 00:48:57.286
Navarro, undock!

00:48:57.288 --> 00:48:58.456
<i>Undock the ship!</i>

00:49:01.225 --> 00:49:03.659
<i>Undocking initiated.</i>

00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:06.328
<i>Please clear the airlock.</i>

00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:19.442
What the fuck is he doing?

00:49:19.444 --> 00:49:20.710
They can't
just leave without us.

00:49:20.712 --> 00:49:22.580
He thinks Andy's
trying to kill Navarro.

00:49:24.282 --> 00:49:25.316
What?

00:49:26.551 --> 00:49:27.685
Wait, is he?

00:49:31.556 --> 00:49:32.724
I don't know.

00:49:36.028 --> 00:49:38.327
Andy? Andy?

00:49:39.564 --> 00:49:40.732
Andy, open the door.

00:49:46.637 --> 00:49:49.373
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stop them.

00:49:50.374 --> 00:49:51.373
Bjorn?

00:49:51.375 --> 00:49:52.608
<i>Bjorn, what are you doing?</i>

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:53.609
<i>You can't just leave us here.</i>

00:49:53.611 --> 00:49:54.845
<i>You gotta come back</i>
<i>and get us.</i>

00:49:54.847 --> 00:49:57.582
Sorry, I can't do that until
she turns that psychopath off.

00:49:59.751 --> 00:50:01.017
What's going on?

00:50:01.019 --> 00:50:02.353
Andy, uh...

00:50:03.856 --> 00:50:06.722
-Andy, he's glitchy.
-What?

00:50:06.724 --> 00:50:07.690
I just need
to get away

00:50:07.692 --> 00:50:09.293
from this airlock right now.
I just need...

00:50:11.462 --> 00:50:12.595
Navarro?

00:50:12.597 --> 00:50:14.563
Are you all right?

00:50:14.565 --> 00:50:15.866
What's wrong?
What do you need?

00:50:22.507 --> 00:50:23.541
Navarro?

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:33.716
Oh, God.

00:50:33.718 --> 00:50:35.419
Oh, my God,
what is that?

00:50:38.623 --> 00:50:40.589
Navarro, please.
Navarro! Navarro!

00:50:40.591 --> 00:50:41.925
Hey, hey, hey.

00:50:42.928 --> 00:50:45.063
I don't know what to do,
I'm sorry. I don't know.

00:50:51.036 --> 00:50:52.002
Someone talk to me!

00:50:52.004 --> 00:50:54.372
Kay, Bjorn, Navarro,
what's going on?

00:51:04.817 --> 00:51:05.851
Help!

00:51:06.751 --> 00:51:08.086
-Help!
-Kay!

00:51:09.387 --> 00:51:11.957
What's happening?
What's happening?

00:51:14.458 --> 00:51:16.427
Please don't let me die.

00:51:19.131 --> 00:51:20.462
Someone help!

00:53:05.871 --> 00:53:06.905
Bjorn?

00:53:07.239 --> 00:53:08.570
Kay?

00:53:08.572 --> 00:53:10.472
We have to go get them.

00:53:10.474 --> 00:53:15.513
<i>T-minus-47</i>
<i>minutes to impact event.</i>

00:53:16.982 --> 00:53:18.114
Doesn't make any sense.

00:53:18.116 --> 00:53:20.016
No, I thought you said
we had hours.

00:53:20.018 --> 00:53:21.785
The explosion pushed
the station's axis off

00:53:21.787 --> 00:53:23.552
by a few degrees,

00:53:23.554 --> 00:53:25.922
just enough to hit the
asteroid belt a lot sooner.

00:53:25.924 --> 00:53:27.159
Where did they crash?

00:53:27.893 --> 00:53:29.025
Romulus Hangar Bay,

00:53:29.027 --> 00:53:30.193
on the other side
of the station.

00:53:30.195 --> 00:53:31.595
-Okay.
-Let's go.

00:53:40.072 --> 00:53:45.110
<i>T-minus-45</i>
<i>minutes to impact event.</i>

00:53:49.147 --> 00:53:52.550
Mother. What's the integrity
of Compound Z-01?

00:53:58.957 --> 00:54:00.524
There's still hope.

00:54:09.067 --> 00:54:10.200
We need to find a way

00:54:10.202 --> 00:54:11.770
to cross
to the Romulus module.

00:54:20.644 --> 00:54:21.577
No, no, no.

00:54:21.579 --> 00:54:23.348
They must've spread
from the lab.

00:54:27.185 --> 00:54:28.752
I don't see
another way.

00:54:28.754 --> 00:54:29.855
Andy, can...

00:54:33.759 --> 00:54:35.557
I heard your voice
in my head.

00:54:35.559 --> 00:54:36.993
Calling.

00:54:36.995 --> 00:54:40.163
ND-255
artificial person.

00:54:40.165 --> 00:54:42.032
Your model
was once the backbone

00:54:42.034 --> 00:54:43.800
of our colonization efforts,

00:54:43.802 --> 00:54:45.769
and it's an honor to be
in your presence.

00:54:45.771 --> 00:54:47.738
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

00:54:48.706 --> 00:54:50.874
I'm Science Officer Rook,

00:54:50.876 --> 00:54:53.877
and I humbly request
your services now.

00:54:53.879 --> 00:54:56.712
I'm afraid I have
just one directive.

00:54:56.714 --> 00:54:59.750
To do what's best for...

00:55:01.019 --> 00:55:03.953
Your upgrade came
with a new directive.

00:55:03.955 --> 00:55:05.323
It overrides the old one.

00:55:06.024 --> 00:55:07.092
I see.

00:55:08.293 --> 00:55:09.961
What's required of me...

00:55:10.195 --> 00:55:11.828
Sir?

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:13.165
To finish our mission.

00:55:21.306 --> 00:55:22.740
-Andy!
-Andy!

00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:24.941
Andy.

00:55:24.943 --> 00:55:26.742
My apologies.

00:55:26.744 --> 00:55:28.945
I was consulting my friend
about our situation.

00:55:28.947 --> 00:55:29.981
Follow me.

00:55:31.682 --> 00:55:33.249
What? Our situation?
How do you...

00:55:33.251 --> 00:55:35.253
Andy! Andy!

00:55:43.395 --> 00:55:45.627
The parasitoids
have no eyes.

00:55:45.629 --> 00:55:47.263
They track you by sound,

00:55:47.265 --> 00:55:49.165
but primarily,
by heat signature.

00:55:49.167 --> 00:55:50.268
What?

00:55:50.969 --> 00:55:52.102
Your body temperature.

00:55:52.104 --> 00:55:53.269
Right.

00:55:53.271 --> 00:55:55.105
If we raise the temperature
in the room

00:55:55.107 --> 00:55:56.705
to match our bodies,

00:55:56.707 --> 00:55:58.875
would that make us
invisible to them?

00:55:58.877 --> 00:56:00.345
If we're quiet enough?

00:56:01.146 --> 00:56:02.848
Just one way to find out.

00:56:10.288 --> 00:56:11.323
Hey.

00:56:14.192 --> 00:56:15.659
This is all my fault.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:19.865
Yeah, it is.

00:56:22.067 --> 00:56:24.336
Yours, mine,
and everyone else's.

00:56:27.038 --> 00:56:29.107
We all decided
to do this together.

00:56:33.744 --> 00:56:35.046
We'll get to them.

00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:42.954
<i>T-minus</i>
<i>40 minutes to impact event.</i>

00:57:14.186 --> 00:57:15.318
The hallway's
temperature

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.953
is now equal to your bodies,

00:57:16.955 --> 00:57:19.055
so the creatures should not
be able to see you.

00:57:19.057 --> 00:57:22.825
But stress, fear, panic will
spike your temperature

00:57:22.827 --> 00:57:24.227
and you'll be exposed.

00:57:24.229 --> 00:57:26.162
Sweat, goosebumps.

00:57:26.164 --> 00:57:28.398
That's your skin trying to
cool your body down.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.001
So watch out for those.

00:57:30.902 --> 00:57:33.838
Now, stay calm and stay quiet.

01:00:29.347 --> 01:00:31.614
Come on. Come on!

01:00:31.616 --> 01:00:35.120
Come on! Come on!

01:00:44.262 --> 01:00:45.962
Okay. Okay.

01:00:45.964 --> 01:00:47.999
Bjorn, let's go. Let's go.

01:01:00.578 --> 01:01:02.111
Fuck!

01:01:02.113 --> 01:01:03.281
Stay back, stay back, please.

01:01:08.219 --> 01:01:09.287
Fuck!

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:14.457
No! Fuck!

01:01:49.494 --> 01:01:50.528
<i>Tyler.</i>

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:53.264
<i>Come on.</i>

01:02:00.572 --> 01:02:01.606
Kay...

01:02:03.776 --> 01:02:05.475
Oh, my God, Tyler...

01:02:05.477 --> 01:02:07.677
Kay, I'm here. I'm here.

01:02:07.679 --> 01:02:10.112
<i>Please, Tyler, help me.</i>

01:02:10.114 --> 01:02:12.183
<i>Everyone's dead.</i>
<i>I can't open this door.</i>

01:02:12.517 --> 01:02:13.551
Please.

01:02:19.390 --> 01:02:21.224
The lever
with the red button,

01:02:21.226 --> 01:02:22.594
there's a key to the left.

01:02:24.496 --> 01:02:25.628
<i>Help.</i>

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:27.029
I can't find it.

01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:28.233
There's not a key.
There isn't a key, Tyler.

01:02:31.135 --> 01:02:32.602
<i>It'll be</i>
<i>there. It has to be there.</i>

01:02:32.604 --> 01:02:34.305
A key. Okay, okay.

01:02:45.416 --> 01:02:47.151
Uh...

01:02:54.058 --> 01:02:55.527
I have the key.
I have the key.

01:03:00.565 --> 01:03:01.731
Oh, my God.

01:03:22.821 --> 01:03:24.055
Run.

01:03:25.356 --> 01:03:26.757
Go! Go!

01:03:50.816 --> 01:03:52.381
Wait!

01:03:52.383 --> 01:03:53.418
Wait!

01:03:54.118 --> 01:03:55.854
Come on!

01:04:04.596 --> 01:04:06.629
You almost closed
the door on him.

01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:09.665
Yes, but I didn't.

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:11.233
I calculated
the timing perfectly

01:04:11.235 --> 01:04:12.637
with more success
than last time.

01:04:13.738 --> 01:04:14.773
Won't you agree?

01:04:15.874 --> 01:04:17.640
We're getting close.

01:04:17.642 --> 01:04:20.209
Let's move.

01:04:20.211 --> 01:04:25.383
<i>T-minus</i>

01:06:59.805 --> 01:07:01.672
Kay...

01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:04.340
We're here. We're here.
It's all right,

01:07:04.342 --> 01:07:05.474
it's all right,
it's all right.

01:07:05.476 --> 01:07:06.511
Andy, open the door.

01:07:06.912 --> 01:07:08.013
It's all right.

01:07:09.047 --> 01:07:10.781
We're gonna get you out.

01:07:10.783 --> 01:07:12.048
Tyler,
open the door.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.651
Open the door. Come on.

01:07:15.319 --> 01:07:16.585
Oh, my God.

01:07:16.587 --> 01:07:17.821
Look at me. Kay,
Kay, Kay. Look at me.

01:07:17.823 --> 01:07:18.721
-Andy, open the door.
-Kay, look at me. Look at me.

01:07:18.723 --> 01:07:20.489
It's all right.
I'm gonna get you out.

01:07:20.491 --> 01:07:21.992
Andy, open the door.
Stop fucking around.

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.026
-What are you doing?
-Don't look

01:07:23.028 --> 01:07:25.829
-over there. Andy.
-Tyler, what's wrong?

01:07:25.831 --> 01:07:27.898
Hey, I need you to open
that door right now, okay?

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:30.901
That's what the creature's
waiting for us to do.

01:07:30.903 --> 01:07:33.569
Open it, please.

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:34.570
Andy.
Andy, open the door.

01:07:34.572 --> 01:07:35.972
Listen to me.
Listen to me. She's pregnant.

01:07:35.974 --> 01:07:38.942
Just, please.
Guys, please. Come on.

01:07:38.944 --> 01:07:40.877
She's gonna
have a baby. Okay?

01:07:40.879 --> 01:07:42.846
-Do you hear what I'm saying?
-It takes that door

01:07:42.848 --> 01:07:44.380
two seconds to open,
another two to fully close.

01:07:44.382 --> 01:07:46.850
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:07:46.852 --> 01:07:47.984
Come on,
what are you doing? Please...

01:07:47.986 --> 01:07:50.653
That's plenty of time for the
creature to get in here.

01:07:50.655 --> 01:07:53.422
Please, please,
please open the door.

01:07:53.424 --> 01:07:55.658
-Why won't you help me?
-Listen, listen.

01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:56.893
-Come on, help me, please.
-You have to run right now.

01:07:56.895 --> 01:07:58.094
-Please, please.
-Run. Run.

01:07:58.096 --> 01:07:59.428
You're one of us, man.
You're one of us!

01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:00.529
Kay, it's the only way.

01:08:00.531 --> 01:08:01.530
-Open the fucking door. Andy!
-You have to

01:08:01.532 --> 01:08:02.464
-fucking run. All right?
-Andy, please!

01:08:02.466 --> 01:08:03.332
-It's the only way.
-Andy!

01:08:03.334 --> 01:08:05.634
-You have to run!
-Please!

01:08:05.636 --> 01:08:07.736
Open the fucking...

01:08:07.738 --> 01:08:10.675
Kay! Kay!

01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:13.409
No, no, no.

01:08:13.411 --> 01:08:14.445
Kay!

01:08:25.556 --> 01:08:26.624
I'll open it.

01:08:27.525 --> 01:08:28.892
She's all right. She's moving.

01:08:28.894 --> 01:08:30.661
No. It's all right.

01:08:38.103 --> 01:08:40.469
Andy,
open the door, please.

01:08:40.471 --> 01:08:42.941
Andy, I need to go
and get her.

01:08:43.909 --> 01:08:45.809
I'm truly sorry.

01:08:45.811 --> 01:08:47.610
There was nothing I could
have done to save her.

01:08:47.612 --> 01:08:50.180
You could have opened
the fucking door!

01:08:50.182 --> 01:08:51.984
We'd all be dead if I had.

01:08:54.152 --> 01:08:55.684
We need to move
before the creature

01:08:55.686 --> 01:08:56.853
finds its way into this room.

01:08:56.855 --> 01:08:57.923
Andy...

01:09:00.058 --> 01:09:02.426
what's your prime directive?

01:09:03.929 --> 01:09:05.730
I'm afraid
I have a new directive.

01:09:06.731 --> 01:09:08.965
To do what's best
for the company.

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:14.004
I need to remove that module.

01:09:14.006 --> 01:09:16.607
I'm afraid that's not in the
best interest of the company.

01:09:23.581 --> 01:09:24.749
We need to move.

01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:26.617
Now.

01:09:36.494 --> 01:09:38.096
How could you do that?

01:09:39.463 --> 01:09:40.498
What?

01:09:41.066 --> 01:09:42.801
Leave someone behind?

01:09:47.239 --> 01:09:48.706
Where are we going?

01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:54.010
To finish a task Rook
has entrusted upon me.

01:09:54.012 --> 01:09:56.012
When completed,
he'll clear the <i>Corbelan</i>

01:09:56.014 --> 01:09:58.848
for departure and open
the docking bay doors.

01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:01.184
You will be free to continue
to Yvaga together.

01:10:01.186 --> 01:10:03.186
And I'll return to Jackson.

01:10:03.188 --> 01:10:04.455
And stay in Jackson.

01:10:08.626 --> 01:10:11.196
That is, assuming
we make it out of here alive.

01:10:22.506 --> 01:10:23.541
We're here.

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.834
<i>Romulus Beta Lab.</i>

01:10:50.836 --> 01:10:55.740
<i>All personnel require</i>
<i>A-1 security clearance.</i>

01:10:57.843 --> 01:10:59.175
What is that?

01:10:59.177 --> 01:11:02.544
Probably some fucked up
bio-weapon, I'm sure.

01:11:02.546 --> 01:11:03.882
<i>Actually, quite the opposite.</i>

01:11:05.851 --> 01:11:07.716
<i>Andy, tell them.</i>

01:11:07.718 --> 01:11:09.551
<i>Tell them what I told you.</i>

01:11:09.553 --> 01:11:11.087
Our colonies are dying.

01:11:11.089 --> 01:11:14.259
Unbearable temperatures,
novel diseases every cycle.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.259
Toxic mine fumes.

01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:19.595
It's all one unforeseen
tragedy after the other.

01:11:19.597 --> 01:11:22.999
<i>Mankind was never truly suited</i>
<i>for space colonization.</i>

01:11:23.001 --> 01:11:25.137
<i>They're simply too fragile.</i>

01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:28.006
<i>They're too weak.</i>

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:32.075
The work of this station
aimed to change that.

01:11:32.077 --> 01:11:33.877
"The perfect organism."

01:11:33.879 --> 01:11:35.814
That's how we should
refer to human beings.

01:11:37.015 --> 01:11:40.784
<i>So, I set this wrong right.</i>

01:11:40.786 --> 01:11:43.889
<i>I took its gift for humanity.</i>

01:11:46.191 --> 01:11:49.025
Inside the parasitoids
I bioengineered

01:11:49.027 --> 01:11:50.659
from the Xenomorph's DNA,

01:11:50.661 --> 01:11:52.898
I discovered a unique
non-Newtonian fluid.

01:11:53.765 --> 01:11:55.932
<i>Life.</i>

01:11:55.934 --> 01:11:59.601
<i>In its most primal,</i>
<i>unadulterated form.</i>

01:11:59.603 --> 01:12:01.271
<i>This microorganism</i>
<i>can be the most</i>

01:12:01.273 --> 01:12:04.240
<i>destructive pathogen</i>
<i>ever observed.</i>

01:12:04.242 --> 01:12:07.243
<i>But acetylated</i>
<i>and synthesized in our lab,</i>

01:12:07.245 --> 01:12:08.878
<i>I've turned it</i>
<i>into the miracle</i>

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.083
<i>Mr. Weyland died</i>
<i>searching for.</i>

01:12:12.084 --> 01:12:13.684
Prometheus fire.

01:12:14.718 --> 01:12:17.655
The divine gift to humanity.

01:12:19.357 --> 01:12:22.192
<i>Z-01 contains</i>
<i>the genome responsible</i>

01:12:22.194 --> 01:12:24.160
<i>for the Xeno's ability</i>
<i>to accelerate</i>

01:12:24.162 --> 01:12:26.863
<i>and slow down</i>
<i>its metabolism at will.</i>

01:12:26.865 --> 01:12:30.133
<i>Its symbiotic capableness</i>
<i>easily rewrites</i>

01:12:30.135 --> 01:12:31.970
<i>the host's DNA</i>
<i>through its blood.</i>

01:12:34.973 --> 01:12:39.809
<i>This is a much needed and well</i>
<i>overdue upgrade for humanity.</i>

01:12:39.811 --> 01:12:43.313
<i>We simply cannot wait</i>
<i>for evolution anymore.</i>

01:12:43.315 --> 01:12:46.116
Yeah, can we
get out of here now?

01:12:46.118 --> 01:12:47.851
My mission is to take
this back to the colony

01:12:47.853 --> 01:12:49.020
for further development.

01:12:49.955 --> 01:12:51.356
Rook is tracking the compound.

01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:53.722
When detected inside our ship,

01:12:53.724 --> 01:12:54.858
he'll open
the docking bay doors

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.928
and set the hauler on
autopilot back to the colony.

01:12:58.230 --> 01:12:59.264
Wait.

01:13:02.033 --> 01:13:03.101
Do you see it?

01:13:07.806 --> 01:13:09.405
There.

01:13:09.407 --> 01:13:11.042
The fucking thing's
huntin' us.

01:13:12.377 --> 01:13:15.178
Right. New plan.

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.414
Can you manage yourself
with a gun?

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.018
Yes, I fucking can.

01:13:26.158 --> 01:13:28.724
Right, this is an
F44AA pulse rifle.

01:13:28.726 --> 01:13:30.692
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

01:13:30.694 --> 01:13:32.061
It's what the
Colonial Marines used.

01:13:32.063 --> 01:13:33.930
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

01:13:33.932 --> 01:13:35.433
So, right,
you put that under your arm.

01:13:38.803 --> 01:13:40.272
That's it.
Right, this hand here.

01:13:43.408 --> 01:13:45.275
All right.
Aim it towards Andy.

01:13:45.277 --> 01:13:46.444
Pull the trigger halfway.

01:13:47.745 --> 01:13:48.947
Don't worry, the safety's on.

01:13:53.751 --> 01:13:55.051
See?

01:13:55.053 --> 01:13:56.819
Aiming assistance.

01:13:56.821 --> 01:13:58.054
If that thing
comes towards you,

01:13:58.056 --> 01:14:00.890
you point it in its general
direction, you'll never miss.

01:14:00.892 --> 01:14:02.761
-Where'd you learn all this?
-Uh...

01:14:04.029 --> 01:14:06.196
Games and magazines.

01:14:06.198 --> 01:14:08.464
You've just got one mag.
That's it.

01:14:08.466 --> 01:14:10.200
450 rounds.

01:14:10.202 --> 01:14:12.003
And you mustn't fire
a single one.

01:14:13.438 --> 01:14:16.007
Acid for blood. Remember?

01:14:17.075 --> 01:14:19.075
We're on the bottom floor
of the station.

01:14:19.077 --> 01:14:20.910
Below our feet
is the vacuum of space.

01:14:20.912 --> 01:14:22.278
You shoot that creature

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.816
and it's a guaranteed
instant decompression.

01:14:25.217 --> 01:14:26.182
And we all die.

01:14:26.184 --> 01:14:28.017
So what's the point
in giving us the guns?

01:14:28.019 --> 01:14:30.019
Because the creature
may see it as a threat,

01:14:30.021 --> 01:14:32.290
and maybe won't charge at us
dead on.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:34.224
Maybe.

01:14:34.226 --> 01:14:35.393
Big maybe.

01:14:36.461 --> 01:14:38.296
I found us a way
through the conveyor belt.

01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:40.098
This way.

01:14:43.501 --> 01:14:44.869
Andy.

01:14:46.338 --> 01:14:47.806
Are you there?

01:15:19.871 --> 01:15:24.909
<i>T-minus</i>
<i>20 minutes to impact event.</i>

01:15:36.855 --> 01:15:38.888
There's a lift
at the end of this corridor.

01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:40.558
It will take us
directly to our ship.

01:15:53.505 --> 01:15:55.271
There's more
of those things.

01:15:55.273 --> 01:15:57.273
Yeah, that's not good.

01:15:57.275 --> 01:15:59.577
They seem to have been
here for quite some time.

01:16:07.118 --> 01:16:08.153
Andy?

01:16:27.572 --> 01:16:29.441
Jesus Christ.

01:16:34.346 --> 01:16:36.114
Busy little creatures.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:51.094
I think we better go back
and find another way.

01:16:51.096 --> 01:16:52.564
That might be a good idea.

01:16:55.166 --> 01:16:56.933
Andy,
see if you can open this gate.

01:16:56.935 --> 01:16:58.403
Stop.

01:17:00.105 --> 01:17:01.172
What?

01:17:13.985 --> 01:17:15.251
Kay!

01:17:15.253 --> 01:17:17.053
Hey!

01:17:17.055 --> 01:17:18.089
Tyler!

01:17:19.224 --> 01:17:20.356
Tyler!

01:17:20.358 --> 01:17:21.393
Kay!

01:17:24.195 --> 01:17:25.230
Kay!

01:17:30.301 --> 01:17:31.336
Kay!

01:17:44.382 --> 01:17:45.417
Kay!

01:17:46.384 --> 01:17:47.452
I got her, I got her.

01:17:50.955 --> 01:17:52.722
It's all right. We got you.

01:17:52.724 --> 01:17:54.058
She's alive.

01:18:02.967 --> 01:18:04.333
Okay, we got you,
we got you.

01:18:04.335 --> 01:18:06.102
Hold on.

01:18:06.104 --> 01:18:07.303
Okay.

01:18:10.675 --> 01:18:12.008
We're here,
we're here.

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:13.543
Tyler, she's losing
a lot of blood.

01:18:13.545 --> 01:18:15.580
Maybe that's why
she hasn't been implanted yet.

01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:18.047
How do you know?

01:18:18.049 --> 01:18:20.616
There's no dead
parasitoid by her feet.

01:18:20.618 --> 01:18:22.587
Andy, this is on you.
So you do something.

01:18:23.455 --> 01:18:25.056
Please! Andy!

01:18:30.061 --> 01:18:33.329
25% of the human genome
is shared with rats.

01:18:33.331 --> 01:18:34.732
And it worked on the rat.

01:18:39.537 --> 01:18:40.572
Come on, Kay.

01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:45.274
Don't.

01:18:45.276 --> 01:18:46.411
What choice do I have?

01:18:47.345 --> 01:18:48.611
We take her back to the hauler

01:18:48.613 --> 01:18:50.513
and we put her
in the cryo-pod. Okay?

01:18:50.515 --> 01:18:52.148
That will keep her alive
long enough to

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:54.016
get her proper treatment
back at the colony.

01:18:54.018 --> 01:18:55.585
I don't trust this.

01:18:55.587 --> 01:18:57.053
Andy, will she make it?

01:18:57.055 --> 01:18:58.356
If we hurry.

01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:18.743
Go! Go!

01:19:25.683 --> 01:19:27.049
I see it. I see it.

01:19:27.051 --> 01:19:28.317
This is it,
this is it.

01:19:28.319 --> 01:19:30.286
I got her.
I got her. I got her.

01:19:30.288 --> 01:19:32.121
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:19:32.123 --> 01:19:33.792
We're so close.
We're so close.

01:19:36.528 --> 01:19:38.261
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

01:19:38.263 --> 01:19:40.630
Hey, we're almost there.
We're almost there.

01:19:40.632 --> 01:19:41.765
You see, you're so close.

01:19:41.767 --> 01:19:43.334
You just gotta hang in there.

01:19:47.505 --> 01:19:48.772
Watch out!

01:19:54.279 --> 01:19:55.378
Tyler?

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.815
Tyler!

01:20:27.145 --> 01:20:28.779
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got?

01:20:35.653 --> 01:20:37.153
Andy!

01:20:44.662 --> 01:20:46.397
No! Tyler!

01:21:56.234 --> 01:21:59.502
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

01:21:59.504 --> 01:22:01.504
This goes
straight to our ship.

01:22:01.506 --> 01:22:04.775
I need you to take this.
And get into a cryo-pod.

01:22:04.777 --> 01:22:07.412
And autopilot will fly you
back to our colony.

01:22:08.513 --> 01:22:10.212
Can you do that?

01:22:12.985 --> 01:22:14.316
Yes?

01:22:14.318 --> 01:22:15.620
What about you?

01:22:16.789 --> 01:22:18.356
I'll find a way back.

01:24:13.404 --> 01:24:14.705
Let me take it out.

01:24:15.706 --> 01:24:17.642
And I'll fix you in return.

01:24:22.815 --> 01:24:24.049
Listen to me.

01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:26.850
You'll die in here

01:24:26.852 --> 01:24:28.350
and that's not
in the best interest

01:24:28.352 --> 01:24:30.588
of the company or mine.

01:25:02.855 --> 01:25:06.825
Come on. Andy, please.

01:25:09.094 --> 01:25:14.730
<i>T-minus</i>
<i>10 minutes to impact event.</i>

01:25:14.732 --> 01:25:15.767
Rain?

01:25:20.438 --> 01:25:21.472
Andy.

01:25:23.075 --> 01:25:25.944
-I'm so, so sorry.
-No, no.

01:25:26.677 --> 01:25:29.513
No, I'm sorry.

01:25:48.901 --> 01:25:50.701
It won't
hold them off for long.

01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:19.162
Come on.

01:26:19.164 --> 01:26:20.696
<i>You're</i>
<i>wasting your time.</i>

01:26:20.698 --> 01:26:22.935
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:26.535
Open the door.

01:26:26.537 --> 01:26:28.737
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>I must deny your petition.</i>

01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:31.207
<i>I just can't risk</i>
<i>compromising the compound.</i>

01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:33.742
<i>But know that I'm grateful</i>
<i>for the invaluable help</i>

01:26:33.744 --> 01:26:35.180
<i>you two have provided</i>
<i>to the company.</i>

01:26:37.748 --> 01:26:38.784
Son of a bitch!

01:26:44.089 --> 01:26:46.156
Andy, open it.

01:26:46.158 --> 01:26:47.192
-Here.
-Open.

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.192
It's not working.

01:26:49.194 --> 01:26:50.693
God damn it!

01:26:56.868 --> 01:26:59.535
<i>I can't lie</i>
<i>about your chances,</i>

01:26:59.537 --> 01:27:01.006
<i>but you have my sympathies.</i>

01:27:20.759 --> 01:27:22.225
<i>Press it,</i>

01:27:22.227 --> 01:27:24.763
<i>so I can take control of your</i>
<i>ship and fly you out of here.</i>

01:27:27.732 --> 01:27:28.965
Who are you?

01:27:28.967 --> 01:27:30.102
<i>A friend.</i>

01:27:32.037 --> 01:27:35.005
<i>Your companions died</i>
<i>so you could live.</i>

01:27:35.007 --> 01:27:36.873
<i>Press the button...</i>

01:27:36.875 --> 01:27:38.709
<i>and let me</i>
<i>honor their sacrifice.</i>

01:27:47.886 --> 01:27:50.554
Andy, can you tell me
one of your jokes?

01:27:52.758 --> 01:27:54.723
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

01:27:57.262 --> 01:27:59.896
-'Cause they taste funny.
-They taste funny.

01:27:59.898 --> 01:28:01.867
I don't understand
cloning at all.

01:28:02.934 --> 01:28:04.136
That makes two of us.

01:28:05.636 --> 01:28:08.604
I read a great book
about zero gravity.

01:28:08.606 --> 01:28:10.641
-I just couldn't put it down.
-Couldn't put it down.

01:28:13.677 --> 01:28:14.712
Rain?

01:28:15.247 --> 01:28:16.281
Rain?

01:28:17.249 --> 01:28:19.182
Rain, what are you doing?

01:28:19.184 --> 01:28:20.718
I'm turning off
the gravity generator.

01:28:22.354 --> 01:28:26.790
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:28.958

<i>four, three,</i>

01:28:31.096 --> 01:28:32.798
<i>two, one.</i>

01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:41.206
Rain, are you sure about this?

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.007
Only one way to find out.

01:28:50.382 --> 01:28:51.649
It works.

01:29:10.202 --> 01:29:12.304
Rain! You're at 40%.

01:29:23.815 --> 01:29:24.881
20%.

01:29:36.161 --> 01:29:38.163
Rain!

01:29:48.739 --> 01:29:50.142
Oh, fuck.

01:29:58.350 --> 01:29:59.885
Stay behind me.

01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:06.424
Andy, be careful.

01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:33.751
Rain!

01:30:50.335 --> 01:30:51.803
Andy, you okay?

01:30:57.976 --> 01:30:59.811
We need
to get to the elevator.

01:31:14.059 --> 01:31:16.326
The elevator won't work
without gravity.

01:31:33.245 --> 01:31:34.279
Ready?

01:31:44.289 --> 01:31:46.224
Rain!

01:31:57.869 --> 01:31:59.371
Fuck.

01:32:14.052 --> 01:32:15.086
No.

01:32:26.264 --> 01:32:27.499
It's a gravity purge!

01:32:38.176 --> 01:32:39.475
Andy!

01:32:39.477 --> 01:32:40.512
Come on.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.226
Andy!

01:34:34.125 --> 01:34:35.258
Get away from her.

01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:43.201

What took you so long?

01:35:27.612 --> 01:35:29.013

-Thank you.
-You're gonna be just fine.

01:36:37.115 --> 01:36:38.216
Both of you.

01:36:47.793 --> 01:36:49.826

01:37:05.443 --> 01:37:06.544
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:37:07.745 --> 01:37:09.314
Change of plans.

<i>Andy, stop her.</i>

01:37:13.819 --> 01:37:15.320
<i>Reconnect us now.</i>

<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>You two cannot do this.</i>

01:37:20.124 --> 01:37:22.325
<i>The compound must be delivered</i>

<i>Have a nice day.</i>

01:37:26.698 --> 01:37:29.298
Now you better listen to me
here, now, you two.

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:32.303
You are insignificant in the
great scheme of things. You...

01:37:39.143 --> 01:37:40.178
No.

01:37:55.426 --> 01:37:58.229
This will keep your systems
online until we get to Yvaga.

01:38:00.231 --> 01:38:02.365
-But I thought that...
-I don't care.

01:38:02.367 --> 01:38:04.202
You're coming with me.
All right?

01:38:05.637 --> 01:38:07.271
If that's
what's best for Rain.

01:38:09.875 --> 01:38:11.910
Andy, I have
a new directive for you.

01:38:13.779 --> 01:38:15.513
Do what's best for us.

01:38:18.951 --> 01:38:20.184
Done.

Good.

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.675

01:38:52.951 --> 01:38:54.617
Oh, no, no.

01:39:24.282 --> 01:39:26.451
